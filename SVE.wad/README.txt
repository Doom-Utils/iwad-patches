Strife: Veteran Edition comes with a PWAD named SVE.wad that overrides
almost all resources from the vanilla strife1.wad and voices.wad
files.  (This maintains the IWADs being their vanilla counterparts and
always playable with Chocolate Strife or the original engine exactly
as intended).

Steam is the only way the game is distributed, so downgrading or
upgrading isn't particularly useful, but since the engine is open
source, someone could run an old version if they are determined
enough.

Version 1.0 is not yet available as a patch.  I don't have it. :-)
