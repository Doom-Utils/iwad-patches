Strife: Veteran Edition comes with a PWAD named SVE.wad that overrides
almost all resources from the vanilla strife1.wad and voices.wad
files.  (This maintains the IWADs being their vanilla counterparts and
always playable with Chocolate Strife or the original engine exactly
as intended).

Downgrading and upgrading isn't particularly useful, but since the
engine is open source, someone could run an old version if they are
determined enough.
