Heretic only had a few public releases: 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3.  The last
of these is also known as "Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders,"
adding two new episodes in a similar vein to The Ultimate Doom.

1.3-to-pwad.vcdiff is special.  It will create a PWAD version of
Heretic, containing only the levels and demo lumps.  It may be used in
conjunction with Blasphemer or htic4doom to see what the levels turn
out like with different resources.

If unsure of which version you have, refer to these sha1 hashes:
