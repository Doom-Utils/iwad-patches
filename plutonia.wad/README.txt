"1.9" refers to the original retail packaging of Final Doom for DOS
and Windows 95, and is by far the most common version of the game
available.  It has been included with various re-releases such as the
Doom Collector's Edition and the Steam version.

"anthology" refers to the less common release that first appeared in
some (but not all!) printings of the id Anthology set.  It includes
deathmatch starts missing from the original version.  This version has
also appeared on the Macintosh Final Doom release and the GOG.com
release.

*-to-pwad.vcdiff is special.  They will create a PWAD version of The
Plutonia Experiment, containing only the levels and demo lumps.  It
may be used in conjunction with Freedoom to see what the levels turn
out like with different resources.  For demo compatibility, you can
come in from either 1.9 or anthology and it creates a PWAD with those
specific versions of the levels.

If unsure about which version you have, refer to these sha1 hashes:
