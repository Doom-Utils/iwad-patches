"1.9" refers to the original retail packaging of Final Doom for DOS
and Windows 95, and is by far the most common version of the game
available. It has been included with various re-releases such as the
Doom Collector's Edition and the Steam version.

"anthology" refers to the less common release that first appeared in
some (but not all!) printings of the id Anthology set. It includes an
official fix for the MAP31 yellow key. This version has also appeared
on the Macintosh Final Doom release and the GOG.com release.
