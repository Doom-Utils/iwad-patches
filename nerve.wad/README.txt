No Rest for the Living was originally released as an exclusive to the
Xbox 360 version of Doom II in 2010, later released as part of Doom 3:
BFG Edition in 2012.  These two releases have an identical PWAD file,
and is called “bfg” here.

The ports of classic Doom with the Unity engine serving as an I/O
frontend eventually were updated to also include NRFTL in an update in
2020.  We call it “Unity 1.1” to reflect the update at whole, but there
is no prior version of nerve.wad in this port.

What release you grabbed nerve.wad out of should be evident, but the
known-good SHA1s are documented here:
3451288383fb16e196f273d9f85d58c1fda97bf4  nerve_bfg.wad
321e951f6cc6e9d51bc16eac53e0d001f0f3f338  nerve_unity1.1.wad
