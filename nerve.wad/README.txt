No Rest for the Living was originally released as an exclusive to the
Xbox 360 version of Doom II in 2010, later released as part of Doom 3:
BFG Edition in 2012.  These two releases have an identical PWAD file,
and is called “bfg” here.

The ports of classic Doom with the Unity engine serving as an I/O
frontend eventually were updated to also include NRFTL in an update in
2020.  We call the first release “Unity 1.1” to reflect the update as
a whole, but there is no prior version of nerve.wad in this port.

What release you grabbed nerve.wad out of should be evident, but the
known-good SHA1s are documented here:
