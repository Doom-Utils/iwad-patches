No Rest for the Living was originally released as an exclusive to the
Xbox 360 version of Doom II in 2010, later released as part of Doom 3:
BFG Edition in 2012.  These two releases have an identical PWAD file,
and is called “bfg” here.

The ports of classic Doom with the Unity engine serving as an I/O
frontend eventually were updated to also include NRFTL in an update in
2020.  We call it “Unity 1.1” to reflect the update at whole, but there
is no prior version of nerve.wad in this port.  The only change added
by this is a DMAPINFO chunk.

On July 15th, 2020, another update added prefixes (e.g. “Level 1:”) to
the map names in the DMAPINFO chunk.  We call this version “Unity 1.2.”

What release you grabbed nerve.wad out of should be evident, but the
known-good SHA1s are documented here:
