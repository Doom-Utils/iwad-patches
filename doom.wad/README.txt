The original Doom and its various versions.  1.1 through 1.8 are
unambiguous, unfortunately, 1.9 is where things become confusing.  The
original 1.9 (“registered Doom” because you used to have to mail id
Software for a copy) contains only three episodes.  The Ultimate Doom
came out in 1995 packaged for retail outlets, and still identified
itself as 1.9.  Much more recently, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes the
original game, and doesn't even identify itself with any version
number.  This file set simply uses “bfg” as the term for it.

The Ultimate Doom from 1995 is by far the most common, and most useful
version, to have.  It is used as the sort of nexus in this file set.
Rather than making a giant directory for every any-to-any version, instead,
you can patch any version to or from Ultimate Doom.

Doom PPC is the IWAD used for the Pocket PC version of Doom.  It has the
Ultimate Doom level set (episode 4 can't be chosen on the device) and uses
a modified shareware TITLEPIC image.  The installer for the game will
modify the IWAD to include random bytes at the end.  ud-to-ppc.vcdiff will
create the IWAD as it is within the installation files without appended
bytes.

Bethesda also rereleased the “PSN” version with DOOM Eternal, which can be
found in your DOOMEternal/base/classicwads folder.

ud-to-pwad.vcdiff is special.  It will create a PWAD version of
Ultimate Doom, containing only the levels and demo lumps.  It may be
used in conjunction with Freedoom to see what the levels turn out like
with different resources.

If unsure of which version you have, refer to these sha1 hashes:
