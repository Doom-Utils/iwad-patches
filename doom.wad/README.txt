The original Doom and its various versions.  1.1 through 1.8 are
unambiguous, unfortunately, 1.9 is where things become confusing.  The
original 1.9 ("registered Doom" because you used to have to mail id
Software for a copy) contains only three episodes.  The Ultimate Doom
came out in 1995 packaged for retail outlets, and still identified
itself as 1.9.  Much more recently, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes the
original game, and doesn't even identify itself with any version
number.  This file set simply uses "bfg" as the term for it.

The Ultimate Doom from 1995 is by far the most common, and most useful
version, to have.  It is used as the sort of nexus in this file set.
Rather than making a giant directory for every any-to-any version, instead,
you can patch any version to or from Ultimate Doom.

If unsure of which version you have, refer to these sha1 hashes:
