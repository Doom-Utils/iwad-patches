CHAPTER [17]: Why won't DOOM work correctly?
--------------------------------------------
        This chapter helps you if you cannot get the game to function as it
should.

[17-1]: How can I use SMARTDRV.EXE with DOOM?
=============================================
         Some people have been complaining about problems with DOOM and
SMARTDRV.EXE.  DOOM is not completely compatible with SMARTDRV.EXE, but
here is how you can get it to work.  Try putting the following command in
your CONFIG.SYS (This will not work in the AUTOEXEC.BAT):

            DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE DOUBLE_BUFFER

        The double buffering uses memory differently than the normal
SMARTDRV.EXE commands.  This command will take up 2k of conventional RAM and
cannot be loaded into high memory.  This has been tested on two machines that
did not work with SMARTDRV.EXE, and this corrected the problem.

[17-2]: Why am I getting an "OUT OF MEMORY" error with DOOM?
============================================================
        If you are receiving an "OUT OF MEMORY" error when attempting to run
DOOM, you might want to attempt any of the following:

        (1) DOOM requires at least 4mb of RAM.  Check to make sure you have
at least this amount.
        (2) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, try holding down the LEFT SHIFT key
during bootup.  This will stop all your TSRs from loading.  Remember to
reinstall your mouse driver, however.
        (3) If you are using MS-DOS v5.0, rename your AUTOEXEC.BAT to stop all
your TSRs from booting.
        (4) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, try running MEMMAKER to free up more
RAM at bootup time.
        (5) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, create a boot menu.  For details
on creating a boot menu, type "HELP MENUITEM" at your MS-DOS prompt.
        (5) Try running DOOM without using HIMEM and EMM386.  If you are
using a different memory manager, try removing it instead.


[17-3]: Why does DOOM crash when I start it?
============================================
        Your motherboard may not be compatible with the DOS extender that
DOOM uses.  Try getting DOOM v1.2.  If that still does not work, try running
DOOM with one of the DOS extenders in the file "altdoom1.zip".  See Chapter
[6] for more information on how to get these files.

[17-4]: How can I run DOOM under OS/2?
======================================
        People have been having a lot of trouble getting DOOM v1.x to work
under OS/2.  Native OS/2 code is being worked on, so hang in there!
Here is a list of settings that many DOOM users have been able to use.

CHAPTER [18]: Why won't my sound card work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------

        This chapter helps fix problems with various sound cards in DOOM.

[18-1]: Why won't my Sound Blaster v1.0 or v1.5 work with DOOM?
===============================================================
        The v1.0 shareware release of DOOM does not work correctly with
earlier versions of the Sound Blaster.  It is recommended that you receive
v1.2 of DOOM to fix this problem.  Information on getting this upgrade is
available in Chapter [6].
        If you insist on using v1.0 of DOOM, here are two different ways to
fix your problem, although they are not guaranteed to work on all computers.

        (1)  If you have a turbo button on your computer, turn it off.  Run
DOOM, and when the title screen appears, turn it back on.
        (2)  Disable the internal cache.

[18-2]: Why won't my Sound Blaster Pro work with DOOM?
======================================================
        If you are using an older graphics card that supports HiColor (16
bit graphics) you may have trouble getting this to work correctly.  The
only recommendation is to borrow a friend's graphics card.
        DOOM v1.1 has a bug that keeps the Sound Blaster Pro from working
on IRQ 2, and later versions do not allow usage on IRQ 10.

[18-3]: Why won't my Gravis UltraSound work with DOOM?
======================================================
        To get DOOM to run properly with both music and digitized sound
effects on the Gravis UltraSound use these three steps.

////// SOUND //////

(1) Set your ULTRASND environment variable, and use GF1 IRQ less than 8

    example:  SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5
                                   |_______ GF1 IRQ

NOTE: DOOM v1.2 may be able to use any valid GF1 IRQ including 11,12,15
      However, high IRQs are _not_ recommended.  See BUGS.


////// MUSIC //////

(2) Doom requires that you have installed the General MIDI patch set from
the 2.06a Install Disks (or later) that came with your UltraSound (and are
also available via FTP and BBS).  DOOM will find your patches (using the
ULTRADIR variable) in the MIDI subdirectory pointed to by ULTRADIR.

    example:  SET ULTRADIR=C:\ULTRASND

    (DOOM will look in C:\ULTRASND\MIDI for the patches)

NOTE:  Step 3 is only required for DOOM v1.0 / Operating System 0.99

(3) You will also need to copy ULTRAMID.INI into your DOOM directory and
rename it to DMXGUS.INI (or find and use the DMXGUS.INI file).  ULTRAMID.INI
is a part of the UltraMID/AIL package (also available via FTP and BBS).


////// SETUP //////

Run the SETUP program in the DOOM directory and select the UltraSound for
both sfx and music.  Now run DOOM!


////// BUGS //////

NOTE: DOOM v1.2 is known to occasionally lockup with GUS support.

If you experience frequent lockups AND are using a high GF1 IRQ
(10,11,12,15), try using a low IRQ (less than 8).

If you experience frequent lockups AND have less than 1024K of
GUS RAM, try upgrading to 1024K (1 Megabyte).

Title                   : GUS1M.WAD
Author                  : Tom Klok
Email Address           : a344@mindlink.bc.ca, a00344@giant.rsoft.bc.ca

Description             : An optimized MIDI instrument mapping for
                          Gravis Ultrasound cards with 1024K on board.

NOTE!  If you don't have a GUS with 1024K, this wad will gain you
       nothing (but shouldn't hurt anything either).
       This PWAD contains no new MUS music files or sounds whatsoever.
       Nor does it require any new .PAT files, just those supplied
       with the more recent install disks.
========================================================================

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
     As you probably know, Doom's wad file contains a resource named
DMXGUS which contains a list of all MIDI instruments (patch file
names) and a table specifying which instruments to load into card
memory. Since all 190+ instruments can't be loaded at once, the DMXGUS
file loads a subset of the full GM set and then maps the remaining
instrument numbers to the loaded instruments.

     I was curious about the internal format of MUS files, and pretty
happy when the MIDI2MUS utility was released.  Thanks, guys!  Mucking
around with the original D_* MUS files Doom is supplied with, I
decided to compare the patches they used with the DMXGUS file to see
what kind of mapping was going on.  It turns out there's a lot of it,
but much of it is poorly set up. id's supplied DMXGUS file is almost
exactly the same as the ULTRAMID.INI file supplied with Ultramid 2.00.
That's a good shot at a generic GM mapping, but Doom never uses many
of the loaded instruments... and many of the instruments it DOES use
are mapped to something else.

     Therefore, I've rewritten the DMXGUS file to match Doom's MUS
files as closely as possible.  I've booted out about 40 unused
instruments and added 29 new ones.  The difference is quite dramatic.
Some of the songs have percussion parts that were being thrown out
before; some of the instruments sound quite different.  It's a shame
that id didn't take the time to do this themselves, but I guess
they've been too busy tweaking other stuff.

Ok, how do I use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Extract the GUS1M.WAD file to wherever you normally put new wad
files (ie c:\doom\wad), then use it as you'd use any other new WAD
add-on:

     doom -file WAD\GUS1M.WAD

That's it!  Hopefully you'll hear the difference as soon as Doom's
welcome screen comes up.

Why only 1024K GUS's?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Well, because that's what I own. :)  It's taken about 10 hours of
work to get the 1024K mapping to the point where I'm happy with it. If
someone else would like to help out with mappings for 256, 512 and
768K boards, then go for it!  Feel free to contact me for a few utils
I've written to make >some< of this easier.  Much of it is still trial
and error.

Will it work with id's shareware release of Doom?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Well... yes, it will.  I'm not sure that should be a problem, as
it's not adding anything that wasn't there before... no new levels,
sounds, music, etc.  It's just touching up something that I feel
wasn't properly implemented in the first place.  And more importantly,
I can't think of any way of preventing it.  The typical means to foil
shareware use for new levels is to either insert them into episodes 2
or 3, or to use textures/objects not found in the shareware release.
Neither would work here.

     Look at it this way: it makes the music Doom comes with sound
better on a 1024K GUS.  If you like the change, register Doom and get
ALL the music!  Please give id your support.  They're writing the best
damn games on the market, publishing them as shareware, and supporting
the GUS.  What more could we want?  Please let them know you
appreciate it.

[18-4]: Why does the game crash when using my Gravis UltraSound?
================================================================
        DOOM v1.2 has a small bug which causes DOOM to crash on some
systems, some of the time.  People have reported that these crashes
can be minimized by using an IRQ at 7 or less, and upgrading the GUS'
on-board RAM to 1024k.

[18-5]: Why won't my Pro Audio Spectrum 16 work with DOOM?
==========================================================
        You may be using an older version of DOOM such as v1.0 or v1.1.
Get DOOM v1.666 for full PAS-16 support in native mode.
        If the game is locking up after the "HU Init" line, there is a
solution.  Make sure you are loading your PAS MVPRODD.SYS driver low.
Loading it high can cause DOOM to lock up.

[18-6]: Why won't my ATI Stereo-F/X work with DOOM?
===================================================
        Turning off DMA buffering in the sound card's SFX.EXE
configuration program should fix this problem.

-----------------------------------------
CHAPTER [19]: Miscellaneous DOOM problems
-----------------------------------------

[19-1]: Why won't my mouse work with DOOM?
==========================================

[19-1-1]: Why does my mouse start moving itself during play?
------------------------------------------------------------
        It is recommended that you upgrade to DOOM v1.666 to fix this
problem.
        Older mouse drivers cause a problem with DOOM v1.2.  Make sure you are
using Microsoft mouse drivers v9.x instead of v8.x.  Logitech mouse drivers
v6.x work as well.  The newest Logitech mouse drivers are available at the
FTP site "wuarchive.wustl.edu" in the directory
"/systems/ibmpc/msdos/mouse" under the file name "drvr???.zip" where ??? is
the version number of the drivers.
        If you continue to have this problem, try playing with the keyboard
or joystick, with the mouse unplugged.  DOOM has a bug that causes it to do
strange things at times.

[19-1-2]: Why won't my two button mouse work with DOOM?
-------------------------------------------------------
        DOOM's SETUP.EXE program assumes that one has a three button mouse.
The left button is "fire," the right button is "forward," and the center
button is "strafe."  If you run the setup program that comes with DOOM, you
can assign "strafe" to the right mouse button, and the setting for "Move
Forward" then appears to be blank. In actuality, "Move Forward" is set to be
permanently "on." This can be fixed easily.  Edit the file "DEFAULT.CFG" in
your DOOM directory with any text editor.  The three lines of interest
are: mouseb_fire, mouseb_strafe, and mouseb_forward. The settings for these
are 0 (left button), 1 (middle button) and 2 (right button).  When you ran
the setup program, mouseb_forward was assigned a value of -1.  Go ahead and
change this to "1", save the file and restart DOOM.  The final entries
should appear as:

mouseb_fire      0
mouseb_strafe    2
mouseb_forward   1

        This will allow you to shoot with the left button and strafe with the
right button.

[19-1-3]: Why won't my IBM PS/2 mouse work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------
        The IBM PS/2 mouse does not seem to work well with DOOM.  id
Software is working on a solution to this problem.  The only current
solution that has been discovered is to load DOOM under Windows.  Doing
this allows the mouse to work perfectly.  DOOM v1.666 fixes this 
problem, if you encounter this, upgrade.

(19-2): Why does netDOOM seem to crash at certain times?
========================================================
        This is a known bug in v1.2 of DOOM.  Upgrade to v1.666, it fixes
this problem.

[19-3]: Why won't my modem work with DOOM?
==========================================
        DOOM seems to be very picky about certain kinds of modems and the
initialization strings you use with them.  Here is a list of initialization
strings that seem to work well.  Many modems have more than one in this
list; if one does not work, try another one.  Place these initialization
strings in the first line(s) of your MODEM.CFG file.

[19-4]: Why is my network slowing down when using DOOM?
=======================================================
        You may have an older version of DOOM, such as v1.0 or v1.1.  These
older versions utilized broadcast packets, which slow down many networks.
Upgrading to v1.666 will fix this problem, since v1.666 utilizes direct
packets.

[19-5]: Why won't the v1.666 patch install correctly?
===================================================
        The DOOM v1.666 patch expects to find the ORIGINAL game in your DOOM
directory.  If you replaced or altered the DOOM.EXE file with a new
version, the patch will not work.
        If the patch complains about missing "LICENSE.DOC" and/or
"FILE_ID.DIZ," the command "PATCH -ignoremissing" can be used.  However,
this will not help if the patch complains about "DOOM.EXE" or "DOOM.WAD."
        If you are using the registered version, some distributors shipped
an older release of v1.1.  It is recommended that you call your
distributor, or E-mail "help@idsoftware.com" if you ordered from id
Software for more help.

[19-6]: DOOM is too easy
========================
        If you find DOOM too easy, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on a harder difficulty level.
        (2) Only save your game at the beginning of each level.
        (3) Never save your game and try completing the mission.
        (4) Only use your fist and pistol for the entire game.
        (5) Turn down your screen contrast so you can see less.
        (6) Use the "-respawn" parameter upon loading DOOM to allow the
            monsters to revive in other difficulty levels.

[19-7]: DOOM is too hard
========================
        If you find DOOM too hard, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on an easier difficulty level.
        (2) Save your game often.
        (3) Try using some of the cheat codes or a cheating utility.
        (4) Turn up your screen contrast so you can see more.
        (5) Press F11 during game play for gamma correction.

[19-8]: I get motion sickness when playing DOOM
===============================================
        There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon.  In short
some people experience dizziness attributed to the game movement.  There were
many theories, most along the line of motion sickness.  Some also said that
the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into believing it to be
real.  Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like being sea sick.
Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration (like on-off high
speed) attribute to the nausea.  I will not go into discussion of why.
Instead, I will post some steps people suggested.  Remedies are not
guaranteed to work.  There are many, all are experimental and some will have
opposite effects on different people.  This, it seems, is a very individual
problem.

        (1) Try different display sizes.  Either use different size monitors
or use the screen size option to vary the display window.

        (2) Try sitting closer/further from the display (don't stick your
nose in it, I don't want you to get radiation sick).  Try combining this with
focusing/defocusing on the display or surroundings.  This is to see if you
are being aware that you are looking at the monitor and hopefully it may
convince your brain that what you play is not really real.

        (3) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try
playing with it on/off.

        (4) Try different input devices.  With a mouse you can control
acceleration more accurately than with a joystick or the keyboard.

        (5) Play on your friend's/colleague's computer. See if it is
better/worse.

        (6) Have breaks while you play.  Play in turns.  Watch others play &
then play yourself.

        (7) If you have sound card, try playing with/without the sound. If
your sound card is stereo try playing with headphones on.   Reverse the
headphones so that left becomes right.

        After switching machines, many have problems adjusting too.
On a 486, things may seem "too smooth."  On a 386, it may make you want to
vomit.  Sometimes you just have to give time to adjust.

CHAPTER *20*: The Night Before DOOM: A Poem From the Past
---------------------------------------------------------

        Last year, about a week before DOOM was released, I wrote a poem 
about "The Night Before DOOM," an obvious parody of "The Night Before 
Christmas."  In celebration of DOOM's birthday, Christmas 1995, and in 
memory of 1994, I return "The Night Before DOOM" to everyone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                         `Twas the night before DOOM,
                          and all through the house,
                   I had set up my multi-playing networks,
                              each with a mouse.
                          The networks were strung,
                           with extra special care
                             in hopes that DOOM,
                             soon would be there.
              The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
             while visions of demons danced through their heads.
                 And my computer's processor it was so quick,
                      boy was I glad I bought that 486.
             When out on the Internet there was a Usenet posting,
                I dialed right in to see what it was boasting.
                 Off to the news reader I flew like a hound,
                 "Oh no," I cried!  The news reader was down!
                 Frustrated, bewildered, feeling really low,
              I leaned back to see what I heard out the window.
                When what to my wondering eyes should appear,
                  but a group of 6 cars, driving 60 I fear!
                With a big young driver, just look at him go!
                 I knew in a moment, it must be John Romero!
                 Over the speed limit, his band of cars came,
            And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
                           "Now, Jay! Now, John!
                            Now, Dave and Kevin!
                           On, Adrian! On, Sandy!
                           On, Shawn and Robert!"
                         To the top of the driveway!
                             Don't hit that wall!
             Now stop your car, stop your car, stop your car all!
                    Leaving the car, he entered the house,
                Walking quietly, so as to not wake the spouse.
           He was dressed in a T-shirt, and a a pair of jeans too,
                   I was unsure of what he was going to do.
                   Boxes of DOOM he had flung on his back,
             and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
         Those boxes - how they sparkled!  The shrink-wrap so tight!
          The character was drawn on the front, just ready to fight!
                The Chain Saw and Shotgun he held in his hand,
              Where was the BFG9000?: The best gun in the land.
                   And then I saw it, strapped to his back,
                Along with a copy of the "Official" DOOM FAQ!
                A wink of John's eye and a twist of his head,
                 Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
             He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
            Installed it on the network, then turned with a jerk.
                      And placing a hand into his jeans,
                   out came his keys - oh how they gleamed!
             He sprang to his car, to the id team gave a whistle,
         and away they all drove, like DOOM's launching of a missile.
             But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
                 "DEMONS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A HELLISH NIGHT!"
