abuse, misapplication or violation of this Agreement.  Any replacement 
Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period 
or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  This warranty allocates risks of 
product failure between Licensee and ID.  ID's product pricing reflects this 
allocation of risk and the limitations of liability contained in this 
warranty.

EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE

OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF ID OR ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY
OTHER PARTY.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion 
may not apply to you.

hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed, except as described herein.  Should 
any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or 
illegal by a court, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions

unenforceable, you agree to a modification of such provision to provide for 
enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable
