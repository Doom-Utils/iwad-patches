This directory contains the vanilla engines for each version, no
patches, just the straight up EXEs.

The patches end up being close to the size of the executables
themselves, and there shouldn't be any real legal objection to them
either, given both the engine and setup programs' source code were
released long ago.

Doom II version "1.666g" is missing from this tree.  The EXEs are
identical to the standard version.  If you're curious about the German
censored version of the game, just patch your IWAD and drop it in with
the regular 1.666 vanilla EXEs.

"Final Doom (id Anthology)" contains the lesser-common version of
Final Doom's engine.  It is a special version originally included only
in some sets of the id Anthology, and most recently, the GOG.com
release of the game as well.
