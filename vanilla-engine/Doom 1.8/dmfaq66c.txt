CHAPTER *11*: What is DOOM add-on software and where can I get it?
------------------------------------------------------------------

        DOOM add-on software is software, not made by id Software, that
modifies, changes, or helps you with your game when playing DOOM.  Some
examples are cheating utilities, map editors, and sound editors.  This
software is in no way endorsed by id, and neither id Software nor myself
take any responsibility for any problems you have with this software.  DO
NOT contact id regarding any of this software.  Most of this software will
not work on the shareware version of DOOM, by request from id Software.
Most of this software is available from these sites unless specified
otherwise.

it by importing a file.  And, if you're really brave, you can export
all the resources in the WAD file to individual files.

     developers integrate new graphics into WAD files.  Deathmatch
     Compilations DM_xx_xx.ZIP; several 9 level episodes containing the
     best deathmatch maps, optimized for use in a single episode (namely:
     DMSMALL1 and DMSMALL2).  Also working on a new solo episode with
     Brant Katkansky, author of NUCLEAR.WAD.  Main area of interest is in
     adding additional graphics to doom missions.

*14-5*: LMPs (Recordings)
=========================

        As far as I am aware, no LMP packages have been released for 
DOOM v1.666 or DOOM II v1.7a.

*14-6*: DEHACKED patches
========================

        DEHACKED (see Chapter [13-2]) allows modification of the DOOM.EXE
file.  DEHACKED can be used to create DOOM.EXE patch files, which are used
to save DOOM.EXE settings to be distributed.  To use a DEHACKED patch,
the DEHACKED utility is required (see Chapter [13-2]).  Using the DEHACKED
utility, type this to use a DEHACKED patch file.

        "DEHACKED <WAD file name/path> -LOAD <patch name>.DEH"

        For example, to use a DOOM.WAD in the C:\DOOM directory, and patch
it with the monster morphing patch, you would use this command line:

        "DEHACKED c:\doom\doom.wad -LOAD monsmorf.deh"

AVAILABLE AT:

        Site (1): wad_edit/doomhack/(filename)

        For a complete list and review of all DeHackEd patches, E-mail 
Michael Adcock at "adcock@menudo.uh.edu" asking for the DeHacked patch 
review.

on-line to get the handshaking going), option NOT to drop DTR after a game
has ended in order to restart the game without losing the connection, and
more.  If you are having trouble with your modem and DOOM, this is for you.

*15-6*: DOOM Color Changer v2.0
===============================

DESCRIPTION:
        This program modifies the DOOM.WAD files' player pictures. This
allows a you to change the way other players are viewed in a 
multi-player game. If you are playing a cooperative game, you can make 
the players white so they stand out and you can avoid hitting them by 
accident. Or, you can make the players dark colors so that a deathmatch
game can be more difficult.  This program will only work on the 
registered DOOM version 1.2.

DESCRIPTION:
        This program was made for all those DOOMers with loadsa WAD 
files. It produces a nice WAD selection interface, which should put an 
end to losing track of all these files. (At least I get more frustrated 
from finding that particular WAD file and typing all that things on the 
command line than from playing DOOM itself!).

(15-15): The DOOM Honorific Titles
==================================

DESCRIPTION:
        When you think your DOOM skills are solid and that no monster in
hell can be a match for your shotgun, you have two basic ways of getting
street credit.  One is to win lots of DeathMatches against well-known
players, and the other is to get one or more "DOOM Honorific Titles".
The DHT is a rating system that awards top players with standardized and
universally recognized titles. If you feel proud and/or silly enough,
you can include the relevant letters after your name in your .sig and
impress your fellow DOOM players.

There are four titles to be conquered:

     DOOM Master (DM):               can complete any level on Ultra-Violence.

     DOOM Grand Master (DGM):        can complete any level on Nightmare.

     DOOM Tyson (DT):                can complete any level on Ultra-Violence
                                     using nothing more than fist and pistol.

     DOOM Grand Ass Kicker (DGAK):   has the combined skills of a Master, a
                                     Tyson and a Grand Master.

The titles are awarded by passing an examination. As with most
examinations, this will only be a random sampling of your
capacity. You won't be required to complete all 27 episodes to prove
that you can do it.

You will be your own judge for the results. You will receive the text
of the examination, which tells you what to do to be awarded the title
you think you deserve; from then on you just have to produce the
corresponding LMPs and upload them to a specific public place in a
specific format to be able to call yourself a DM, DT, DGM or DGAK. There
is no time limit. The LMPs must be produced especially for the
examination -- you can't just send in your old ones. This is because
there is an authentication mechanism which prevents people from
recycling other people's LMPs.

*15-30*: Internet DOOM Client/Server System v0.12
=================================================

DESCRIPTION:
   The DOOM* Client/Server System is a front-end to DOOM TCP/IP network 
drivers.  You use the client software to connect to a Frag Server. While 
connected to the server, you can chat with other players and bystanders 
and negotiate game parameters. You tell the server what parameters you 
want, and when all the players are ready, the server will give the 
client the decided game parameters plus the IP adresses of all your 
victims. The client software will disconnect from the server and then 
run a multi-player DOOM game (iDOOM* or linuxxdoom*).

[15-33]: OLDIPX.ZIP
===================

DESCRIPTION:
        These are some files which may be useful in getting DOOM running over
a TCP/IP network.  Included is an older version of a 3Com Etherlink III
packet driver from 3Com, which has been found to be more reliable than
the newer version from the Crynwr collection.  Also included is an older
version of the Crynwr collection, which includes a number of useful
utilities that were taken out of the newer version.  An old version of an
IPX-to-PD converter is also included, which seems to run much better with
DOOM than the new version by Intel.
        Other files include a copy of the DOOM IPX FAQ.
