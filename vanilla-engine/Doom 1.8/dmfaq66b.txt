CHAPTER [9]: How can I cheat in DOOM?
-------------------------------------

*9-1*: What are the DOOM cheat codes?
=====================================
        Here is a list of the cheat codes from DOOM.  During play, just type
the codes in with the keyboard.  You need not hit ENTER after the code.
After entering, a message should be displayed at the top of the screen
telling which cheat mode was activated.

  idbehold        Displays menu (followed by S, V, I, R, A, or L for choice)
                        S=Strength (Berserk)
                        V=Invulnerability
                        I=Partial invisibility
                        A=Full Automap (computer map)
                        R=Anti-radiation suit
                        L=Light amplification visors
  idchoppers      Gives you the chain saw (long story behind the message)
  idclev          Warp (followed by episode number and level number)
# idclip          No clipping (you can walk through walls)
  iddqd           Degreelessness mode (God mode)
  iddt            Toggles Automap between normal, full, and full with objects
                  (enter when in Automap mode)
+ idfa            Gives full ammo, 200% armor, and all weapons but no keys
  idkfa           Very Happy Ammo (full ammo, 200% armor, all weapons & keys)
# idmus           Changes the music to a certain mission (followed by 
                  episode and level number)
  idmypos         Displays your bearing and coordinates in hex
@ idspispopd      No clipping (you can walk through walls)

#: Found only in DOOM II
@: Only found in in DOOM I
+: Only found in DOOM v1.4bt and up

*9-2*: What command line parameters exist?
==========================================
        To use most of these parameters, start DOOM by typing:
"doom -devparm <parameter> <more parameters>".  If the "-devparm" parameter
is not needed, the parameter will be marked with a plus (+).  Most of these
parameters can be mixed and matched to create different effects.  For
instance, typing "doom -devparm -wart 1 8 -record demo01 -respawn" would
record a demo on episode one, level eight, with monster respawn.  Lastly,
typing F1 during development mode will allow a 256 color screen capture in
PCX format.

@<filename>                    Used to read in a command line parm file
-altdeath                      Activates DeathMatch v2.0 (v1.4 and above)

-debugfile <parameter>         Dumps debugging info to debug<parm>.txt
-devparm                       Puts you in developers mode
-episode <episode>           + Starts on episode (1-3)
-GUS                           Uses the original GUS instrument mapping
-GUS1                          Uses the new GUS instrument mapping (default)
-fast                      +++ Nightmare mode without respawn
-file <name w/ .WAD>         + Allows usage of an external PWAD file

-nomouse                       Does not use the mouse
-nomusic                       Does not play background music
-nosfx                         No sound effects
-nosound                       No sound at all

-shdev                         Internal development, texture mapping
-skill <skill level>         + Starts on skill level (1-5)
-statcopy                      Unknown
-timedemo <name w/o .LMP>    # Calculates the number of times the screen is
                               redrawn when playing a demo
-turbo <speed 1-255>           Increases the speed of the marine
-warp <episode> <level>        Warps to episode (1-3) level (1-9)
-wart <episode> <level>        Loads a PWAD named ExMy.wad

+: Does not require the "-DEVPARM" parameter.

++: If you have a network, try setting up a network game with three players.
    The three terminals should have the parameters:
                "doom -devparm -nodes 3 -left"
                "doom -devparm -nodes 3"
                "doom -devparm -nodes 3 -right"
    Then, set up the left and right terminal monitors next to the middle
    monitor, in a virtual-reality type configuration.  When you turn your
    head, you see the screen turned 90 degrees!  This ONLY works with
    versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 of DOOM.

+++: Must be used in conjunction with the "-WARP" parameter

#: For the "-playdemo" and "-timedemo" options, if you give an LMP file name
   of "demo#" (i.e. "demo3"), then that internal demo will be played if the
   external LMP file is not found.  For example, to play the internal 1.6
   shareware demo #2 (multiplayer demo), type "doom -playdemo demo2".
   Additionally, when using "-timedemo," the game will give you two 
   numbers after you quit to DOS, GAMETICS and REALTICS.  To determine
   the DOOM frame rate use the formula (GAMETICS/REALTICS) * 35.

Note: DO NOT name your LMP demos ExMx.LMP, or they will *NOT* work.

        If anyone has any idea what the "unknown" or question marked
parameters do, send me some E-mail!

[9-2-1]: What do the dots that appear in development mode mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------
        Direct from id, the final formula for calculating the frame
rate that the dots represent has been determined.  The formula to convert
dots to frames per second is:

                                 70
                        --------------------
                        <NUMBER OF DOTS> + 1

--------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [10]: Can someone tell me how to...?
--------------------------------------------

        This chapter is full of spoilers for people who are "stuck" in the
game.  Enjoy!

[10-1]: Where are the DOOM secret levels?
=========================================

[10-1-1]: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------
        You must be on level three to access the secret level in DOOM.
First, there is a room with an elevator with armor on it in the northwest
corner of the map.  Press the red button in this room. This opens a corridor
in the room where you can see a glowing sphere.  The room it leads to has
some lighted alcoves.  Walk up the stairs.  You should be able to hear a
mechanical sound.  This is the sound of two alcoves being lowered.  The map
looks similar to this drawing.  (I love the beauty of ASCII art)

                        Alcove 1 /\ /\
                                 \/    \
                                /   /\   \
                              /     /  \   \
                            /   /\/      \   \
                            \   \        /   /
                            /\   \    /    /
                            \/ \   \/      \
                        Alcove 2 \     /\    \
                                   \/     \    \
                                            \    \
                                              \ x
                                             ENTRANCE

        Walking into this room normally, the alcoves rise before you can see
them.  But, if you run up the stairs to one of the alcoves fast enough,
you can get in it and rise to a secret door.  Alcove 2 leads to the
blue glowing sphere.  Alcove 1 leads to an island surrounded by ooze.
You can get a rocket launcher here.  In alcove 1, follow the ooze down
the tunnel.  The tunnel leads to a switch that raises the bridge over the
opening ooze pit.  A secret door is also near the switch, but the bridge
leads to the secret exit.  REMEMBER TO >BOOK< TO THE ALCOVE! :)

[10-1-2]: The Shores of Hell
----------------------------
        When you get to Command Center, walk out the elevator door, and
turn right.  Walk up the stairs in the far right corner.  At their top of
the stairs, enter the door to the right.  Walk to the end of the hallway.
Open the door, and look to the right.  Open that door and turn the switch
immediately on the right in that room.  That switch raises stairs in the hall
you just left.  Walk up those stairs, get through the red curtain, and get on
the transporter.  Kill the lost souls in the room you are transported to
and open the hidden door there (a lion head marks it).  Again use the
transporter, and you will find yourself walking towards a marked EXIT-door.
Enter and turn the switch!

(10-1-3): Inferno
-----------------
        The process of getting to the Inferno secret level is probably one of
the most creative things in DOOM, and the most difficult to figure out.  The
way to get there is from level 6, "Mt. Erebus".  You must get inside a blue
box with no ceiling which is in a large triangular depressed area with
"water" at its bottom.  Inside it is a skull switch ending the level. Getting
inside the box counts as one of the secret passage units for the level.  Next
to the box is a large red building which one can get on top of.  To get on
top of it, you must use the secret teleporter in the building with the
berserk pack and stairs in it, with the four Imp cages by the entrance.  For
specifics, the teleporter leading to the ledge above the blue box is located
at <0x27ed486,0x2315201>.  Upon entering the building, you will see a secret
opening to the teleporter on the left.  The teleporter takes you to a ledge
on the top of the red building.  If you go to the right along the ledge you
will be looking down at the blue box.  Unfortunately, the distance is too far
to jump.  The key is to shoot a rocket at the ledge wall, the explosion of
which will throw you into the box!  The area on the ledge where you want to
fire the rocket at the wall is located at <0x375bead,0xa900072>.  There is a
rocket launcher on the level, on a platform out in the open with a chaingun
and a bunch of monsters.  Finally the exit inside the blue box itself is
located at <0x37f436d,0xc1ffa3c>.  You will take a lot of damage in the
process, even with lots of armor and health, however, there are a few
invulnerability artifacts on the level which will protect you.  One is next
to the wall where the launcher and chaingun are, and the other is inside a
central shack that opens when you enter a nearby enclosure to pick up the
green armor.

*10-2-1-2*: Secrets in Detail
-----------------------------

KNEE DEEP IN THE DEAD

E1M1: HANGAR:

# Just after the zigzag look right for the oddly colored wall <0xBA389D6,
  0xf0e054ec>.  Push it for corridor to a open place with a blue armor vest.
# After you cleaned out the exit room, go back to the zigzag room and look
  right for the shotgun (the tower with the Imp should be lowered now)
  <0xd68473b,0xf2510f63>.
# For DOOM v1.2, a secret area has been added in the above secret room:
  look in the SE corner <0xdeff476,0xf0effdc2> for the elevator.  You'll find
  some armor bonuses up there.  The elevator lowers when you are at the
  entrance <0xb96c465,0xf4879655> in the north, so you'll have to run fast to
  get it.

E1M2: NUCLEAR PLANT:

# The small structure you face when you begin, has a secret door in the SE
  corner (the lighter wall part) <0x15005a8,0x121e8ad>.  Behind the door is a
  room with a red switch.  Pushing that switch will open a secret door in the
  northern corner of the stairs in the east <0x60ada92,0x3affa0b>.  You can get
  outside and collect a supercharger and a chaingun.
+ Behind the red door you'll see a stair twisting to the right.  On the top is
  an indention to your left <0xf9900144,0x3a49ddd>.  If you step on it, it will
  drop down.  You will find enemies to your right, and you will also see (but
  not be able to get) the chainsaw.
# A bit ahead you'll see a lift.  Push the first panel to your left
  <0xf9d0052a,0x5aa56a6>.  You'll be able to kill those Imps from the ridge.
# In the southern part of the maze (to get in, pull the switch behind the pillar
  in the green toxic directly to the right behind the red door <0xfdc004de,
  0x446230f>), shoot the middle most western wall (the one behind the green
  armor vest) <0xf79e0d81,0xfe82feac> for access to the chainsaw (push the
  switch in NW to lower the pillar so you can get it).
  In the same hidden area is some extra armor hidden behind the eastern wall in
  the northeastern corner of the stairs <0xf82fdc62,0x151532f>.
# In the most eastern part of the maze, push the wall between the white stripes
  <0x1eff099,0xfc88d4d4d3> for a backpack.

E1M3: TOXIC REFINERY:

+ The strange grey wall straight ahead beyond the first door you open is a
  secret drawbridge.  The switch for the drawbridge is in one of the chambers
  described below.
# In the room in the NW (the one that opens as soon as you push the red button
  and that contains the yellow key) are TWO secret passages (the second niche
  on your left <0xf3c7ca46,0xf7dfc822> and the second niche on your right
  <0xf5ac3fd1,0xfac4d713>), both will open when you're on the stairs but will
  close again after a (very) short while.  Go to the stairs and then run like
  hell as soon as you hear them lower. It'll help when you shoot the drums that
  might get in the way.
# In the northern niche (leading to a rocket launcher and a green armor) is a
  secret room in the SE corner (just follow the green stuff to the right).
  Run fast for minimum damage.  You'll see a backpack and the switch for the
  drawbridge at the beginning.  To the east is the exit (a lighter colored
  wall part <0xf6aff87a,0xfbd990b9>) through another secret chamber
  containing the chaingun.
# In the south-eastern niche (the second on the right) is a supercharger (pull
  the switch on back of the pillar).
# The drawbridge should be lowered now.  Cross it, but be careful! There are
  a lot of Imps lurking behind automaticaly opening doors.  My tactic is to
  select the chain gun, run forward and back up as soon as you hear the doors
  open.  Then take them out at your leisure.  Note that you can also shoot some
  of them via the secret `window' in the SE <0xf9480573,0xf8b2d736>.
+ In the north of the room is a corridor, follow it to find the hidden-level-
  switch.
# To the north of the room with the hidden-level-switch is a elevator, push the
  wall <0xfbe7f1f6,0xfaafee8c> to lower it, so you can get the rocketbox.
# Behind the blue door in the eastern corner is a secret door (the lighter
  patch in the SE <0xfd6ffcd8,0xf7a33c3b>).  The chainsaw, a supercharger, a
  blue armor and a partial invisibility is available.

E1M9: MILITARY BASE:

You start facing a open space with a cage full of Imps in the middle. The
following rooms are described relative to that cage.

+ In the northeast is a pentagram on the floor.  If you touch it, numerous
  enemies will warp in.  Try walking around it and then running to the
  corridor.  That way you can pick them off one by one.
+ In the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor at the middle of the eastern wall
  <0x75cf281,0x2fa03b> (the highlighted patch on the floor).  To the NE are a
  green armorvest.
# Also in the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor in the SW-corner <0x6102f19,
  0xff10138d> leading to a indoor lake with the chaingun.
# The same area is accessible via the lift/trapdoor in the NE-corner
  <0x3d000fe,fcd013ff> of the southern room.
# In the northern chamber, push the middle eastern wall <0x3efe3b3,0x479d0cd>.
  You'll get into a chamber with several high pillars.  The pillar at the far
  side of the room <0x7ad637b,0x423de32> lowers when someone is on the stairs.
  Just run on it, wait for it to rise, and 'jump' to the other pillars by
  running fast counter clockwise.
+ To get to the end of level switch, run down the trench.  To the NW is a
  isle with the switch and to the south is the lift upstairs.
+ Although they don't count as secrets in themselves, getting on the
  five pillars, each with a weapon or bit of ammo on it, in the secret
  room on the right hand wall of the room with the ooze trench and
  exit, is one of the more challenging things to do in the game.
  Basically, the room on the secret level of episode one "Military
  Base" contains five pillars of increasing height as you go around
  clockwise, along with a lift which lowers when you are on the entry
  stairs, allowing access to the first and highest pillar. The key is
  to go around each pillar in a counter-clockwise direction. Just
  running and jumping toward a pillar isn't enough, as you will go over
  it but fall off the far side, and this can only get you to the first
  and tallest pillar, and the shortest (or maybe the first two on
  either end if you manage to swipe the item off the top of the second
  pillar before falling). The key is to shift+forward run at each
  pillar, take off and jump toward it, and right when you reach it,
  briefly press the down arrow to move backward. This will stop your
  running and you will be standing still on the next pillar. If you
  move back too soon you will hit the pillar and fall to the ground;
  too late and you run off the far side. It's best to give yourself a
  running start for each pillar and line yourself up so you will be
  jumping over the minimum distance possible. Using the automap under a
  high zoom level can help here. This actually isn't as hard as it may
  seem to get right. I understand some can do this all in one fell
  running swoop by turning in mid-routine, but this is a surer way.

E1M4: COMMAND CONTROL:

# The light wall to the left in the beginning (before the door) <0x785a47f,
  0x45005ef> hides a backpack.
# The south exit from the round chamber (the one with the radiation suits)
  leads to a trench.  Follow the trench east for the rocket launcher and a
  supercharger.  To get the supercharger, simply stand on the left side of
  the lift and press the switch.  If you are just barely on the lift, you
  can reach the switch while on the lift.  Follow the trench west to get
  out.

E1M5: PHOBOS LAB:

# The chamber in the middle (behind the first stairs you encounter from the
  start) has a secret chamber to the south (behind the drums) <0x15a4aa6,
  0x1a0025b> with a shotgun.
# In of the east of this chamber is a toxic lake.  In the SE-corner of the
  toxic is a secret passage (the strangely colored wall) <0x466e20d,0x12009bc>.
  There is a rocket launcher and a blue armorvest.
+ In the NW behind the yellow keycard door is a chamber with two pillars and
  an isle with a switch in the green stuff.  In the indention in the west
  <0xf8e024a0,0x34ff9c5> is a secret chamber with the antiradiation suit. The
  south wall of this chamber hides another room with the chainsaw. The south
  wall thereof gives away to let you outside and get the supercharger.
  You can get the blue armor in the NE-corner by stepping on the northern
  pillar when it's down, waiting until it rises again and then 'jumping'
  over.  Ammo can be found by repeating the same action on the souther
  pillar.
# Two platforms with Imps hidden in the walls behind the yellow keycard door
  act as elevator in DOOM v1.2.  The southern one doesn't lead anywhere.
  The northern one <0xfc2fd5ee,0x4f92783> has a secret wall to the east which
  leads to a secret room with a partial invisibility and a shortcut to the
  darkroom (via the north).  The pentagram is a teleporter back to the
  beginning.
# In the north eastern chamber (the one with the blue floor and the blinking
  light) has a secret chamber to the SE <0x52fbab5,0x3d001f3> with a backpack,
  a chaingun and a computer map.
# In the northern darkroom is a partially hidden chamber to the SW.  The best
  way to get there is to follow the wall left.  You'll find the night vision,
  which is very useful in sniping those baddies in the dark.
+ In the northern darkroom the top of the /\ in the middle wall is also a
  secret door, but as far as I can see this isn't really useful (maybe for
  dashing for the exit?)

E1M6: CENTRAL PROCESSING:

+ At the first 'crossing' you encounter, look in the NW corner.  There is a
  partially hidden chamber <0xfd4ff0b2,0xfe5ab835> with some ammo, health and
  a green armor vest.  There are also some Imps there, so to be safe, fire a
  shot into it to detonate the barrels and kill them.
# Behind the red door in the southwest is a green lake.  In the NE-corner
  is an anti-radiation-suit.  In the 'middle' (the tunnel in the SW) is a
  supercharger.  In the SE-corner is a nightvision, a partial invisibility,
  a blue armor and the exit from the lake.
# Just before you are by the blue door there is a secret chamber to the
  south.  Before you're at the blue door, there is a tower with Imps
  <0x31dc6cd,0xfdc354b5>.  When you reach the blue door it will lower so you
  can get in.  You will see an anti-radiation-suit. Push the south wall for a
  backpack, a rocket launcher, a partial invisibility and a back way into the
  room with the yellow key.
# In the same area as where the lowering tower is, is a corridor to the north.
  As soon as you get the yellow key, it will be accessable.  The twisting path
  over the toxic waste will lead to a backpack and a door to the outside. There
  you will see a supercharger on a pillar <0x1125332,0x6c93ef6>. The pillar
  will lower as soon as someone goes near it. Step on it and as soon as it has
  risen, press the wall to the west to get inside the complex again.
+ In the room immediately before the ending room, there is a radiation suit
  available behind one of the pillars.
# In the most eastern corridor is a strangely colored wall <0xd2ffa4f,
  0xf9fc115f>.  Push it to get the computer map.

E1M7: COMPUTER STATION:

# In the southwest is a big pillar <0xfe5cda63,0xf7ff97d9> that will descend
  when you are on the stairs east of it.  Stand on top of it, wait until is
  has risen sufficiently and jump on the ledge in the NE <0xffdfe6c0,
  0xf9237c97> for the computer map or the south lake in the NE corner
  <0xff1e2866,0xf72ffeb0> for the chaingun and (when you leave via the secret
  door to the east) a backpack.  Jump in the lake in the north and run fastly
  to the tunnel in the NW <0xfdf75b77f,0xfa229120>.  In the west of that tunnel
  is a radiation-suit and in the east behind the door with the light are some
  goodies and a switch.  Throwing the switch will allow you to get to the
  chainsaw later on in the room in the extreme SW <0xfacc64c4,0xf5a40aa1>.
  Leave the tunnel via the north and look behind the pillar <0xfea017a9,
  0xfacffbc5> in that lake for blue armor.  Follow the acid to the north to the
  supercharger <0xfdb37a3a,0xffa1e2e2> and leave via the east.
# After you get the blue key in the northwest, two hidden areas will open to
  free Imps and former humans.  The secret room in the middle of the map
  <0x1319742,0xfa50049c> has a false wall to the east which leads to
  outside so you can get a partial invisibility.

E1M8: PHOBOS ANOMALY:

# The only secret room <0x1cfdaa6,0x17bdce1> is in the east in the corridor
  leading to the first door and contains a supercharger.
+ Note that there is a map in the east of your starting point.

THE SHORES OF HELL

E2M1: DEIMOS ANOMALY:

# The SE-corner <0x63aba49,0xfdd82d07> of big room in middle (the one with
  the windows to the east, the south and the west) turns into a teleporter to
  the plasma-gun after you pull the switch <0x4e7f923,0xfee0883b> on the outer
  west side and push the button on the west side of the little wall that rises
  out of the floor (the east switch opens the passage to the red key).
# In the SW is a indention <0x31cb145,0xfb50105e> with two skull-switches.
  Press the eastern skull-switch first for access to a teleporter to a
  corridor filled with bonuses in the north.
# Behind the red door <0x186bb69,0xfd97f0a8> is a blue mega armor and the
  computer map.

E2M2: CONTAINMENT AREA:

# If you walk along the south border of the storage area (the one with all
  those boxes), you'll bump into a box <0xff9751f6,0xb101ab0> which will lower
  if you are north of it, to reveal some shotgun ammo.
# In the south east quadrant are three circles with parts of the floor going
  up and down.  The northern one has a secret corridor <0x82ff4df,0x22fd506>
  in the north leading to the blue door in the north, filled with
  life-bonuses.
# In the SW area (with three corridors with the blue lights on the ground and
  ceiling) is a partially hidden corridor <0xff85ce0a,0x6b92713> in the NW
  corner of the most western corridor. When you try to get the backpack, the
  wall behind you will close and the wall in front of you will lower,
  revealing some Imps. The door behind you will open after a while. The
  SE corner <0x2afe532,0x7011ab87> (the black-colored wall) is the
  secret door to a small chamber.  The SE corner <0x3682291,0x6ebaa52>
  of that small chamber (the wall with the small green light) hides a
  corridor <0x4afeea4,9x667fa8e> back to non-hidden territory (the
  lightly colored wall).  The most south part of the corridor
  <0x414d0b4,0x5d0039e> (the black wall part) gives away to a
  computermap.
# In the south middle quadrant is a room <0x1baafb3,0x1d7344b> with two
  pillars, one khaki, one with tubes (to get there leave the three
  corridors with the blue lights via the way you came in.  Turn right
  and first left. The room on your left [east] is the one you seek).
  The west (khaki) pillar <0x31dc5c4,0x2901565> has a switch on the north
  side, with which you can lower the eastern pillar to get the plasma
  gun.
# In the south middle quadrant is a corridor with skull crushing
  doors.  To get by them, run forward as soon as they start to go up.
  Take them one at a time.  The middle one <0x3f4c349,0xff1006b4> (third
  one from either side) has a secret passage in the north ridge, leading
  to the chainsaw.  When you get it lost souls will try to get you from
  hidden rooms in the south and east.
+ The room <0x6ec4d6b,0x3a0ad08> with the yellow keycard in the south
  middle has a bridge hidden under the red blood, following blue lights
  on the ceiling, just walk forward and back again fast to make them
  rise.
# The western room behind the yellow door <0x456db4c,0xdc9ca53> contains
  the chaingun, just flip the switch!
# In the eastern room <0x852f5ab,0xdadd4d9> behind the yellow door
  you'll see three rooms to your right and three auto-rising pillars to
  the north. You can get the backpack on the middle pillar by running
  over the pillar when it starts to rise or later on. The switch on the
  eastern pillar <0x95f38f8, 0x11901ab9> opens the middle door
  containing the rocket launcher.  Flip the switch on the middle pillar
  <0x85ba244,0x11900694> for the south chamber (with ammo) and the one
  on the west pillar <0x75fa7ef,0x11900ad> for the north chamber
  (containing a rocketbox). It's best to pull all switches after each
  other.  Note that the pillars lower as soon as you enter one of the
  rooms, so you can't open any doors after that! (but you can get the
  backpack).
# To get the last secret go into the room with the blue keycard,
  <0x9e4f2bb,0x5affb22> and look up at the four corners.  Note that the
  extreme southeast corner is lit up unlike the other corners. Go and
  stand in this corner and face along the wall.  The platform with the
  supercharge on it will lower <0x9e41c9a, 0x5eff45c>.  Run across and
  get it before it rises again.  It will only go down once, so you only
  get one chance at it.  This is one of the harder secrets in all of
  DOOM to find and get to.

E2M3: REFINERY:
# In the most SW corner of the map is a corridor <0xfba6989a,0xfed0450f>
  to the room with the blue key containing the plasma gun.  To get the
  plasma gun, jump in the red blood and run north (right) fast.
# In the middle south is a room with a five-sided green lake.  The wall
  <0x2847ab9,0xfe90013e> to the south east (the part with between the
  light lines) offers a shortcut.
# The next secret on this level is similar to and next to the one
  above.  You can get out of the room with the green lake
  <0x25ff9c6, 0xfe9f8db4> via a one way secret door on the wall in front of
  the main entry way, which leads back to the room with the imp cage.  The
  other secret door above refers to a one way door into this room which is on
  the wall across from where the rising and falling platforms with candles on
  them are.
# In the south east is a partially hidden cage with Imps
  <0x1de36ff,0x10156d>.  You can enter via the NW corner <0x2effa57,0x951b16>
  to get the backpack.
# Follow the corridor behind the blue door through the open area and the room
  with all those pillars and blinking light to the green toxic stuff.  If you
  go around the corner <0x52fff7d,0x313783c> in the SE, you will find a
  radiation suit.  In the middle of the eastern wall <0x6729d81,0x42cd91e> of
  the green stuff is a corridor to a room with the supercharger in the NE
  corner <0x85000da,0x3eac965>.

E2M4: DEIMOS ANAMOLY:
# In the middle of the south wall <0xfd743e02,0xf5510517> of the beginning room
  (directly opposite to the TL's to the north), hides a room with the shotgun.
# Take the teleporter to big room.  In the north is a elevator.  Press the
  head left of it to go up.  You'll see a green armor and a computermap.
  To get them push the little red pillar <0xadc846c,0xfebfff01> with the skull
  on it in the NE corner.
# To the north of the big O formed by green toxic waste is a secret door
  <0x59bf44d,0xfb6fe831>. It opens if you have walked via the corridor
  <0x75b231a,0xf6c3a683> in the SE of the big O.  There is a supercharger and
  radiation suit. (Don't forget the partial invisibility south to the entrance)
# To the west of the big O with green toxic waste is a corridor with a T to the
  north <0x213d209,0xf9a64b57>. To the east of that corridor is a secret wall
  <0x27fad41,0xfab20726> with a partial invisibility and a chaingun. Shoot the
  wall to get them.
# In the great round corridor in north, behind the blue door: In the east is a
  `dent' <0x4ed2810,0xff5f15c1> in the ring. This is a trapdoor with a secret
  door to the east and leads to a plasma gun and a teleport to the middle of
  the great round corridor.
# In the great round corridor in the north: follow NE corridor to a room with
  lava.
  - The small door <0x62ffe68,0x3b6bde> in the SW leads to a small green lake.
    The SW corner has a blue armorvest behind some drums.
  - In NE corner <0x815a37c,0x2c8c810> behind the lava is a secret door.
  Warning! the SE branch of the corridor behind it leads to a crushing ceiling.
  Outrun it and push the green patch <0xa6ffd1d,0x64560a> in the east for the
  exit. The SW branch lets you go back to the lavaroom.
# In the room above, just over the edge of the wall, is a small ledge
  with some medikits <0x6ff9294,0x22b3e1f> on them which normally aren't
  visible from the room and can be missed when running over the lava to the
  secret door.
# In the south middle behind the place where you find the blue keycard, is a
  small twisty path <0x3550d3b,0xf5c84264> high above the acid.  In the SW
  part of the toxic <0x35019f4,0xf510358a> is a berserker.
# After you open the door to the exit, look back and get the supercharger
  <0x7e9bcac,0xf5497b99>.
+ Note: for those of you still searching for that damn switch so you can get
  to the exit: go in the lake and then towards the exit.  The switch is on the
  right wall of the teleporter left of the exitdoor.

E2M5: COMMAND CENTER:

# The room where the first door leads to has two secret rooms in the space
  between the room and the stairs.  The doors <0xfb80ba93,0x7dbd7cc>
  <0xf8373cba,0x7e031f5> are facing the south and will open automatically to
  reveal Imps and ammo.
+ The ridges <0xfca60096,0x3febfc5> <0xf71000d0,0x3e622b8> of the green lakes
  of the big room south of the begin both lead back to normal territory.
# In the SW is a roughly (--) shaped room.  In the room NW of the middle
  of this (--) is a switch <0xf3efdd28,0x1367f57> which activates a stair so
  you can walk through the fake fire <0xf29412f7,0x18d236d> in the NW corner.
  The teleporter there takes you to an area infested with lost souls.  The west
  wall <0xf4690f4,0x496136d> with the head leads to another room with
  transporter.  That transporter takes you to the switch <0xfe9fb836,0x92ff44b>
  for the secret level.
# In the room east to the room in the south middle with the room to the N,E,
  and W and a view to the circular stairway in the south, is a secret door
  <0xfbaff1cb,0xae3ad8> in the NE corner (near the cozy head-fire) hiding the
  chainsaw.
# In the center of the circular stairway is a anti-radiation suit guarded by
  a demon.  The door <0xf94949db,0xfe6d93d0> to it will open as soon as
  you are at the top of the stairs <0xfa165eed,0xfdd56896>.
# The south door directly after the circular stairway leads to two corridors.
  The eastbound corridor is the way to the exit, the westbound leads to C
  formed green lake in the west.  In the north of that lake is a door
  <0xf1a21e52,0xfe94f08f> (behind the ammo clip).  Follow it to a baron of hell
  in a cage.  North of that you will see a long corridor with three doors to
  the east.  The northern and southern doors lead to a ledge around the lake
  to the east.  The middle door <0xf27dc571,0x826c8a6> (the wall part with the
  pentagram over the ugly head) leads to the isle <0xf5420514,0x823f2c1> in
  the middle of the lake, where you'll find a plasma gun. To activate the
  bridge to the isle, you have to push the button <0xf2aff9f7,0xfd1cd93e> in
  the room in the center of the C-formed lake you passed while coming here.
  BTW: If you fall in the lake, the transporter <0xf42dc0b0,0x7500bcf> in the
  indention in the SW brings you back to the beginning.
# In the slime lake mentioned above, not only is there a teleporter,
  but there is also another niche with a cell pack in it
  <0xf29859a4,0x8bf7c8b>.

E2M9: FORTRESS OF MYSTERY:

There are no secrets in this level.

E2M6: HALLS OF THE DAMNED:
+ In the SE where you find the blue keycard, two rooms with demons will open
  automatically. The SW one has a chainsaw behind the brown wall <0x6362f60,
  0xff151336>.
+ Three parts of the mazes are secret.  All the secrets are off the area at
  the north of the level after going down the long narrow passage to the
  junction.
# The area to the east with the fake exit counts as a secret.
# The area to the north with the goodies on the table counts as a secret.
# The area to the west past the crushing ceiling counts as a secret.


E2M7: SPAWNING VATS:

# In the NW is a corridor with ribbles.  The third indention is a corridor
  leading to a very dark open patch.  In the NE <0x126cccd,0x772feab> is a
  switch which opens a room with a chainsaw.  In the SW <0x32fff5,0x3de1cbe>
  is the plasma gun.
# In the SW is a room with a radiation shield and small patches of green
  acid in indentions along the walls.  The SW indention <0x137b2c8,0xff25986d>
  has a corridor to the south leading to a chamber with a rocket launcher and
  a teleporter.  The teleporter will get you to a red door, with a switch
  <0xffe013c6,0xfd1015b7> behind it.  Pushing that switch will open an
  oute door to a secret room in the beginning-room <0x5d894b7,0x76751d7>
  (SE corner) with a supercharger.  Because this room is protected by two
  doors, a second switch must be flipped to open the second door.
+ To open the inner door, flip the switch that is past the blue keycard
  door, up the stairs, and to the left in the room with the acid pool
  <0x4205835,0x2d00641>.


E2M8: TOWER OF BABEL:

There are no secrets on this level.

INFERNO

E3M1: HELL KEEP

# The small grey chamber before the exit has a secret room <0xfc900da5,
  0x7606912> in west containing the rocketlauncher.

E3M2: SLOUGH OF DESPAIR:

# To get a chaingun, follow the wall to your right (west) to the chaingun
  behind the wall.  The wall will lower when you walk over the red patch
  <0x6b010ab,0x75220b7> to its west side.
+ The second `finger' from the east has some cages with former sergeants.  To
  get into those cages, walk over the red triangle <0x3fa278b,0x817fa0c>.
  The floors of the cages lowers and a wall behind you will come down.
  To lower the triangle column (actually it rises) you want to shoot the
  back wall of one of the six cages the sergeants were in. Shooting it
  raises the pillar exposing the red triangle, walking over which
  lowers the sergeant platforms allowing you to get the stuff in each one.
# In the large circular room at the end of the middle finger is a
  supercharge.
# The plasma gun is hidden in the western part <0x2072324,0x4ecdc0e> of the
  pillar you see when you stand with your back to the second `finger' from the
  west.

E3M3: PANDEMONIUM:

+ In the starting room, a megaarmor can be obtained on a ledge overlooking
  the yard in front of where you start.  When you go up the stairs to the
  right, and then down the elevator to the area which has stairs going down
  to where the blue key is, there is actually a second elevator in the wall
  which leads up to the ledge with the armor.  This second elevator
  <0x48189c,0xfe5f9916> can only be used once, and you must move back
  slightly after pressing the button or else the elevator will catch half way
  up under an overhang.  The armor's ledge does damage so grab it quickly.
+ Directly north of the beginning is a great open place with 4 pillars.
  Pressing the switch <0xfea95756,0xaff327> in the north will lower the middle
  pillar <0xfe921ce9,0xfef4c1db>, so you can get the shotgun.
+ To get to the rooms with the windows to the room in the beginning, go
  north and take both the east and the west stairs, and then south.
# A little north of the middle is a round green lake <0x120905e,0x1754b6d> with
  a lavalike ceiling.  In an indention <0x1c9c5cd,0x1c492ee> in the east is the
  chaingun.
# In the SW is a corridor with two platforms (one in the north and in the
  south).  There is a small corridor in the south.  When you follow it, you'll
  come to a T-split.  In the west (right) is an invulnerability, useful for
  running over the lava in the east. Take the turn left (east).  You should be
  on the southern platform of the corridor.  In the south of that platform you
  can see a lava/blood maze <0xfd9760e5,0x1de4aec>.  In that maze you'll find
  the BFG9000 <0xff1ebaad,0xdeec44> in the SE corner and a supercharger
  <0xfe3afdf3,0x2101114> in the NW corner.  You can also get to the lava maze
  by going directly north from the beginning, then taking the west stairs,
  then following the path north.
# One of the most northern chambers (the one just before the blue door leading
  to the exit) has two air shafts flanking a formation you could describe as a
  coach facing north.   When you stand on the coach <0xff6e17cb,0x532520e> the
  wall part west of the stairs south will lower allowing you to get the map.
  The wall part <0xfffcfa97,0x41c62aa> east of the stairs will lower when you
  push it.
# The last two secrets are in the area to the east of the level, off
  the east hall and over the stairs guarded by lost souls.  Just
  entering the room around beyond it with the lava and Cacodemon counts
  as one secret.  Getting to the area past that with the berserk pack
  and armor counts as another.

E3M4: HOUSE OF PAIN:

+ The first room to the west from the beginning has a secret room <0xfebbbdcd,
  0xc4c579> in the SE corner containing the shotgun.
# In the SW (a bit behind the blue door) is a room with a doors to the east
  (the entrance), to the north (where you find the BFG9000 <0xffdaa1b0,
  0xfd07e1fa> in some lava), to the west (where a lot of Imps and a baron of
  hell await you) and to the south.  The south chamber has a secret room
  <0xff49f58f,0xfae5873e> to the west filled with rockets.
# In the south middle east of the blue door is a room with a door to the north
  and a small patch of blue lake on the east side.  Press the wall <0x3ddce70,
  0xf9d91cc3> a bit more north of that patch of blue for a green armorvest.
+ In the middle is a room with two pillars with switches on all sides.
  Here is a rude ascii-chart of the scene to facilitate solving this.

# As drawn above, there is a secret wall <0x6cffeee,0xfdd03be8> in the south of
  the most eastern indention.  It contains a radiation suit.
# The final secret for this level is located to the left of the starting
  room, past the Cacodemon cages and behind the wall.  Using the teleporter
  across the lava to enter the room counts as a secret.

E3M5: UNHOLY CATHEDRAL:

# Take the most western entrance to the cathedral.  Push the west wall
  <0xfc4e8e97,0xfc5dfd80> and get the lightamplifier <0xfad56408,0xfc1fa3ee> in
  the SW corner.
# The most NW chamber (the one with the lava floor) has secret door
  <0xfa4ed057,0x61933f5> to the east with a radiation suit.  The transporter in
  the room leads to the middle of the map/cathedral.
# The east wall <0x2d56f0d,0x9b29c1> of the big central room of the cathedral
  (the one with the four 2x2-teleporters) hides a small niche with a
  supercharger and a chainsaw.  The yellow key is required to open this
  door.
# Also the four stony structures to all sides of the middle warp-in are hollow.
  The doors will automatically open each time you warp in to the middle from
  another place (from outside to inside).
# In the cathedral are four 2x2-teleport-places.  The northern two are
  connected to the north by a corridor.  That corridor has a secret passage
  <0xfd48642a,0x56afd0c> in the NW.
# The most northern room has three switches and a teleport with crushing
  ceilings.
  The SE-switch opens the secret doors in the corridors to the east and west,
  enabling you to get the rocket launcher and some rockets.
  The NE-switch lowers the blue key in the NW-corner.
  The NW-switch lowers the chaingun in the NE-corner.
  The teleporter in the SW teleports you to the NE corner of the cathedral.
# The most eastern room (east of the exit) has a small pit, from where many
  enemies will warp in.  To the east of that room, behind the skull <0x787fd10,
  0x2eaf2e4>, is the BFG9000.
+ For those of you wondering just which damn transporter you have to take to
  get out the middle of the cathedral: it's the most southwestern of the
  northwestern patch of transporters.

E3M6: MT. EREBUS:

+ In the east is a cubus-formed building on a hexagon isle. The east alcove
  <0xd1027ea,0xfe2234b7> is the way in.  In the NW corner <0xb9d75d8,
  0xfeb0d1db> is the backpack.  Pushing the skull <0xbd80026,0xfe22bffe> on
  the west wall lowers the wall in the SE, releasing the enemies trapped there.
  Pushing the skull <0xc5fdf50,0xfe67fb05> on the north wall lowers the wall
  in the NE, so you can get the radiation suit there.
# In the north is a NW-SE oriented structure with two cages with Imps at
  both sides of the entrance.  That structure has a secret door inside in
  the middle of the NE wall <0x3a60e7c,0x356d9b4> (at the small light on the
  floor) and a teleporter in the middle of the SW wall <0x281e808,0x22e23de>.
  The teleporter will put you on a high structure further north.  From
  there you can 'jump' west and get the chainsaw.  You can get out via the
  transporter in the SE side <0x34a6f68,0x9bd1900> of the structure you warped
  on.
# East of the above described NW-SE oriented structure is a small _|_ formed
  building on a small hill.  The building contains two teleporters.  The
  eastern warps you on the NE ridge of the hill, where you can get the plasma
  gun <0x7e352bd,0x1c1c059>. The western transporter also warps you to a ridge
  (NW) of the hill, but there are only some shotgun shells there.
+ The small blue building <0x941bec7,0x293e0bb> in the NE contains a radiation
  suit and cacodemons.
+ All compact flaming red structures contain enemies and a few soul spheres
  or a radiation suit.  Sometimes one of the walls goes down, spilling the
  enemies.
# See Chapter [10-1-3] for information on getting to the secret level.
  This counts as a secret as well.
# The fourth and final secret passage area on this level is inside the
  same building room with the secret teleporter leading to the blue box
  ledge.  On the opposite wall is another hidden wall opening
  <0x3aa61a5,0x365963f> which contains a cell pack.
+ The exit is in the middle west: follow the south wall over the lava, you'll
  see a tunnel <0xfb186e6b,0x54a49e> going north to the blue door, and further
  the exit beyond.

E3M7: GATE TO LIMBO:
# Beyond the northern blue door is a maze of small lava tunnels.  In the SE
  corner <0x7a37332,0x5bec063> of this maze is the BFG9000 and a transporter
  to the SW quadrant of the map.  In the NW is a transporter <0xff7323ef,
  0x824218c> warping to the SW quadrant, the red key <0xfe3f638e,0x6fd04ca>
  and a red door.
+ There are several pillars in the various lava-lakes with red doors, all
  containing transporters:
  (0) In the most SW lake is in the north a pillar <0xf9e908db,0xfc8d60ac>. It
     warps you to a room where you can see the yellow door.  In the same room
     is also a switch <0xfcaffa88,0x45f8a18> on the east wall, pushing it
     activates a bridge in room (1).
  (1) In the middle (big) lake is also a pillar <19c3b9d,362e08> with a
     transporter. It warps you to the room west of the above room.
     In this room is also a yellow door, in it is a switch that activates the
     bridge to the pillar in the middle of a lake (.
  - In the most northern lake are two pillars (east/west). The western pillar
    <ffa72354,6c46d07> has a transporter to the SW ridge looking out over the
    middle pillar..... The switch <f9d003cc,569d8a4> opens a door???
    The eastern pillar <2d380df,57aafc9> leads to the ridge east, with the
    yellow key...
  - SE: 31ff6e7,faea6d2e> NE of tower, with plasma gun.
  - In the NW lake is in the north a pillar <0xfe1aff7a,0x4093707> containing a
    transporter. It warps you to the yellow door.

E3M8: DIS

+ Not a real secret room, but in case you are wondering: the room in the middle
  contains a plasma gun and a blue armorvest.

E3M9: WARRENS

+ This level is very similar to E3M1, but is much more difficult.
# Just like in Hell Keep, there is a rocket launcher just in the west of the
  small grey chamber <0xfd20a96c,0x76057af> in the NW.  This rocket
  launcher is not available on Ultra-Violence mode and above.
+ Note that many of the hidden rooms full of enemies (the rooms that open when
  you go over the transporter-lookalike in the NW) contain weapons and other
  goodies.  Most beneficial of those is the BFG9000 in the SW corner of the
  lake (west behind the entrance).

Level 30: Icon of Sin
  The only secret here is how to complete the level.  At the south end
  of the final room is a switch which raises the platform in the lava
  to the north (with the box of rockets).  Hit the switch and wait for
  the platform to go up.  Then go to the platform, hit space to lower
  it, and get on.  Just before it gets to the top, shoot a rocket into
  the exposed brain of the demon.  Then jump down and lower the
  platform again.  This takes about three tries.

*10-2-2-2*: Secrets in Detail
-----------------------------

All the official secret areas in the game are numbered and listed below,
along with the sector number, IDMYPOS coordinates, and decimal coordinates.
"Official" secrets are those which are counted towards the "Secrets" total
on the end level screen.  Some non-secret areas which are hard to find
are also listed, but are not numbered.

Level 1: Entryway
 1  41 < 8b00000,13700000> ( 2224,  4976)
  In the northernmost room, you see two switches; a near one on your
  right, and a far one on your left.  The one on the right opens a
  small area to the northeast with some armor and health.  Hit the
  right switch before the left one, since the left one makes the right
  one go away.  (Although if you stand in the right place and hit the space
  bar, you can still open the secret door, even if the switch is gone.)
 2   8 < 67c0000, bd80000> ( 1660,  3032)
 3  17 < 9b80000, a0c0000> ( 2488,  2572)
 4  57 < 9a10000, f800000> ( 2465,  3968)
  In the center room (just south of the exit), there is a lift to the
  west.  Go up the lift and hit space on the wall to the west,
  revealing a few imps and a switch (#2) which opens a door leading
  outside in the southeast corner of the center room.  Outside (#3)
  are some imps and a shotgun.  Once you hit the switch at the top of
  the lift, jump down onto the platform just east of the lift.  This
  will open a room with a rocket launcher to the north and east (#4).
 5  28 < b4e0000, ba60000> ( 2894,  2982)
  A room with two imps and a stimpack, behind a hidden door on the
  south side of the east wall of the center room.

Level 2: Underhalls
 1  20 < a4c0000, 87b0000> ( 2636,  2171)
  Just southwest of the red keycard (at the top of the steps) lies a room
  with blue armor.  There is also a teleporter back to the beginning.

Level 3: The Gantlet
 1   5 < da00000, ac90000> ( 3488,  2761)
  In the main room, south of the two sets of stairs and the rocket
  launcher, is a small outcropping with a ledge.  You can make it over
  the ledge if you run southeast at the right angle from the raised
  area west of the stairs.  Try standing at <b8cf79f,e2495ca> at angle
  dbf00000 (or thereabouts) and running straight forward.  Once you
  make it, walk through the south wall to a small room (#1),
  containing a supercharger and partial invisibility.  There is also a
  teleporter to the tower with the rocket launcher.

Level 4: The Focus
 1  15 <fdca0000, 4890000> ( -566,  1161)
  The hallway south of the starting point leads to a staircase, then
  curves east to a door.  On the left side of the corridor are some
  windows into rooms containing armor and lots of sargeants.  Near the
  east end of the corridor, there is a hidden door on the north wall,
  just to the right of the window, which lets you into the south
  windowed room (#1), and from there to the north windowed room.
 2  14 <fe020000, 34b0000> ( -510,   843)
  On the way to the blue key is a room with a lava pool in the
  northwest.  Jump in the pool; there is a secret door to the north,
  leading to a room (#2) containing a double-barreled shotgun.
 3  43 <ff9f0000, 6250000> (  -97,  1573)
  Once you get the red key, walk east off the platform.  There is a
  teleporter there, which takes you to the area just south of the
  staircase mentioned above.

Level 5: The Waste Tunnels
 1 139 < 6840000, 1c00000> ( 1668,   448)
  Just behind the supercharger in the north area of the map (not the
  one at the start) is a small room with a beserker.
 2   3 < 3510000, 1ad0000> (  849,   429)
  Starting in the room with the blue key (the one with red doors at
  the west and east ends), walk north through the window and press
  space on the north wall.  Then run north until you're in the room
  with the plasma gun.
 3  52 < 1800000,fa440000> (  384, -1468)
  On either side of the exit are doors to a room containing some ammo.
  Jump down from one of the ledges on the west or east sides of the
  room.

Level 6: The Crusher
 1  98 < 4200000, 2600000> ( 1056,   608)
  Of the two southernmost pillars in the room just west of the starting
  point, the eastern one contains a secret.  Hit space on its north or
  east wall to lower it, revealing a megasphere.
 2 124 < 24e0000, 1130000> (  590,   275)
  The poison river in the room with the blue keycard leads southeast to
  a room with a teleporter, which takes you to the staircase just east
  of the plasma rifle.
 3 146 <ff420000, 7520000> ( -190,  1874)
  In the northwest corner of the room with the spiral staircase is a
  little outcropping with a few chaingun sargeants.  You can jump into
  it from higher up on the staircase.  (Don't try jumping straight
  west; you need to jump a little bit north, too.  Try running
  straight ahead from <1698256,70dce25> at angle <6d480000>.)  In the
  middle of its west wall is a door leading to a secret room with lots
  of cool stuff, including a megasphere.

 Also: the blue door north of the starting room leads to a lift.  After
 lowering the lift, you will see a little room to the south of the
 lift with some armor.

Level 7: Dead Simple
 1   1 <fda00000,ff600000> ( -608,  -160)
  The platform around the end-level switch in the center.  Kinda hard to
  avoid, unless you're playing deathmatch, in which case there is another
  end-level switch (along with a BFG9000) in the northwest corner of the map.
  There is no way into that room from the outside, so you can't enter it in
  single player.  There is a deathmatch start in there, however, and you
  can open the door from the inside.

Level 8: Tricks and Traps
 1   6 < f200000, 74c0000> ( 3872,  1868)
 2 125 < f200000, ae40000> ( 3872,  2788)
 3  12 <10550000, 9200000> ( 4181,  2336)
 4   9 <102c0000, a290000> ( 4140,  2601)
  Through the door east of the starting point is a room with three
  teleporters; two obvious ones to the left and right, and a third one
  in the center which you can get to by shooting the lion.  All three
  take you to a small octagonal room with a pillar in the center.  The
  left, right, and center teleporters take you to the north, south,
  and east ends of the room, respectively.  Shoot the north and south
  sides of the pillar to open up secret doors behind the teleport
  exits, revealing some ammo (#1), and a chaingun (#2); unfortunately,
  it also reveals some pain elementals, so you can decide for yourself
  if it's worth the trouble.  From the east end of the room (which is
  secret #3), if you jump west over the slime to the center of the
  room, a door will open up in the northeast corner of the room.
  Actually, hitting space on the door will have the same effect.  This
  door (#4) leads to two radiation suits, ammo, partial invisibility,
  and a teleporter back to the octagonal room.
 5  57 < 2f40000, 9500000> (  756,  2384)
  Through the door southwest of the starting point is a cacodemon and a
  chainsaw.  As you take the chainsaw, a door will open up revealing a
  little more of the passageway (#5), containing some ammo and green
  armor, as well as a baron, who will teleport to the east to block
  your exit.
 6 100 < bc00000,10320000> ( 3008,  4146)
 7  98 < ea40000,11400000> ( 3748,  4416)
  In the room with way too many demons are two switches on the south side.
  The west one opens a door on the north wall leading to another door.
  If you have hit the switch in the room with all the cacodemons, then
  this door will be open, leading to a room (#6) with even more demons
  (though you won't see them at first; some doors open after you pass
  by them).  There is a candle on the east side of it, marking a door
  which you can shoot open to reveal the BFG9000 (#7).

Level 9: The Pit
 1 109 <fc600000, 2600000> ( -928,   608)
 2 118 <fd070000, 3050000> ( -761,   773)
  West of the starting point is a corridor leading to the supercharger.
  Once you get it, one of the corridor walls will open up, revealing a
  doom containing a rocket launcher and two rockets.  You can try to
  jump for the launcher, or you can just walk off the northeast edge of
  the platform on the southwest corner of the room; the floor will
  raise up so you can easily get the launcher (#1).  Once you do,
  some doors to the north and east will open up, revealing some sargeants.
  If you try to walk onto the platform with the rockets (#2), some doors
  will open up behind you revealing a wall of chaingunners, who will
  probably negate whatever benefit the supercharger gave you.  :-)
 3  16 < 5c00000, 6db0000> ( 1472,  1755)
 4  17 < 5ac0000, 6c00000> ( 1452,  1728)
 5  22 < 5840000, 6ec0000> ( 1412,  1772)
  On the east side of the map is a room with a hexagonal structure with
  imps and sargeants firing down at you.  If you walk up to the structure,
  the ledge that the bad guys are standing on will lower you, allowing
  you to walk up onto it (#3).  On the north side of the structure is
  a door leading to interior of the structure (#4), which is crammed
  with imps and lost souls.  Opposite the door, and a bit to the right,
  is a hidden door leading to the BFG9000 (#5).
 6  43 < 2d50000, c950000> (  725,  3221)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a spiral staircase of sorts, a
  large, circular series of steps that lower as you walk up to them.
  If you make it all the way up the staircase (clockwise), you can jump
  down to an area with ammo, a supercharger, blue armor, beserk, and
  a teleporter back to your starting point.

Level 10: Refueling Base
 1 114 <fda20000, 2480000> ( -606,   584)
 2 111 <fda00000, 1380000> ( -608,   312)
 3 112 <ff200000, 2800000> ( -224,   640)
 4 116 <fc260000, 2800000> ( -986,   640)
  The round skylit room south of the starting point has four big brown
  pillars, each of which contains a secret area.  These pillars open
  when you enter the room from various directions.  When you enter
  from the south, the center (#1) and south (#2) pillars open doors
  facing each other; they contain health and various monsters.  The
  south one contains a radiation suit, which can come in handy, since
  all these secret areas have acid floors.  When you enter from the
  west, the east pillar opens, revealing health, ammo, and various
  monsters, which may include a pain elemental or two (#3).  When you
  enter from the east, the west pillar opens, revealing the same sort
  of thing (#4).
 5   5 < 5c00000, 8c40000> ( 1472,  2244)
 6  12 < 3c60000, 7000000> (  966,  1792)
 7  26 < 80a0000, 5c00000> ( 2058,  1472)
 8 180 <f8b00000,f9600000> (-1872, -1696)
 9  34 < 57a0000, 5400000> ( 1402,  1344)
10  49 < 37d0000, 4d50000> (  893,  1237)
11  80 < 6400000, 3480000> ( 1600,   840)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a room with a lot of sargeants
  and former humans.  There are a lot of small niches in this room;
  several of them have secret doors behind them which you can shoot
  open.  You can usually identify them by the fact that they have the
  large white UAC logo on them, rather than the small gray ones.
  There are five such secret doors; behind them, you can find a
  supercharger (#5); light amplification and 200% armor (#6); health,
  armor, demons, a backpack, and a teleporter (#7) (the teleporter,
  which is behind the door at the end of the hidden hallway, takes you
  to room in the southwest (#8), with a invulnerability and an ammo
  box, just west of the room with the cyberdemon); an energy pack
  (#9); and armor, a beserker, ammo, and various monsters (#10).  Also,
  the switch in the southeast corner of the room opens a door to a
  hidden hallway (#11) which leads to the room with all the
  arachnotrons.
12  74 < 7a50000,fbbd0000> ( 1957, -1091)
13  71 < 6840000,fc000000> ( 1668, -1024)
  In the southeast corner of the arachnotron/revenant room is a secret
  door to a hallway (#12) leading south; it contains light amplification
  goggles.  The secret door you emerge from is marked with green pillars.
  Up the steps to your north is another secret door, also marked
  with green pillars; it contains armor, beserk, and ammo (#13).
14 101 <  600000,fffb0000> (   96,    -5)
15  59 <  1c0000,fcc00000> (   28,  -832)
  In the room with the rocket launcher on the pedestal, northwest of
  the room with secret door #13, you can run past the rocket launcher and
  get onto the north ledge with the imps on it (#14).  There is some
  health and green armor up there.  The ledge on the south side of the
  room is actually a lift, which you can lower by hitting space.
  There are two boxes of rockets up there (#15).
16 120 <f8e00000, 4f00000> (-1824,  1264)
17 121 <f8e00000, 4e00000> (-1824,  1248)
18 122 <f8e00000, 4e00000> (-1824,  1248)
  In the northwest, there is a room with two acid floor areas and
  some pillars with stuff hidden behind them.  On the southwest wall,
  there is a section of wall with mismatched texture; when you
  walk near that section of wall, a door opens in the northwest
  acid pool.  The door leads to a megasphere, which counts as
  three secrets (#16, #17, #18).

  Also note that just southeast of your starting point is a secret
  door to a room with some goodies, but it's not an official secret.

Level 11: 'O' of Destruction!
 1  28 < 6600000, 3240000> ( 1632,   804)
  On the east side of the map is a small room containing a chaingun
  with green torches on either side; you get to it via a lift which
  lowers when you come down a set of stairs.  On the south side of
  this room is a secret door, which opens onto a hallway (#1) which
  leads to a ledge where you can get partial invisibility.  Also, note
  that there is a supercharger west of the set of stairs mentioned
  above, on the left (south) side of the door.  Just walk through the wall
  to the right of the green torch.
 2  75 < 67e0000, 71f0000> ( 1662,  1823)
  On the east side of the outer part of the circle (north of the
  walkway leading east, south of the outcropping with the supercharger
  on it) is a hidden door in the slime.  It opens when you cross the
  trigger that reveals the arch-vile.  The door leads to some boxes of
  rockets (#2) and a teleporter which takes you to some energy packs
  in the center of the circle.
 3 114 <ff480000, 9fc0000> ( -184,  2556)
  In the northwest corner of the map is a series of bars which open
  automatically when you approach.  Just north of the bars is a secret
  door (#3) leading west to the hell knight and invulnerability.

Level 12: The Factory
 1  26 <fd950000, 3000000> ( -619,   768)
  In the northwest corner of the big main building is a room with
  jagged walls (#1); it contains a BFG9000 and lots of chaingunners.
  To open the door leading there, you must hit the switch in the
  southeast corner of the room with the blue door facing northwest.
  Note that there is a radiation suit in the southwest corner of
  that room.
 2  85 < 3040000, 2c00000> (  772,   704)
  The room with the blue door facing northeast (with the platforms
  that lower as you reach them) contains a teleporter to a ledge
  facing northeast outside the building.  From there, you can jump
  down to the southwest and get three boxes of ammo (#2).  Hopefully
  you already killed the mancubus.  This room also contains a switch
  which helps you get secret #4.
 3 155 <fef80000,fc730000> ( -264,  -909)
 4 122 <ffa00000, 1200000> (  -96,   288)
  In the southwest corner of the map is a small building with some
  crates.  High on the east wall are a chaingun and some ammo (#3);
  you can get to them by stepping from crate to crate until you
  get to the lift (the switch), and then use the lift to get up
  to ledge they're on.  In the southwest corner of the room is
  a teleporter which takes you to the square structure in the center
  of the big main building.  If you hit the switch mentioned in #2
  already, then the center of this structure will be raised up so
  that you can just grab the supercharger (#4).  If you haven't,
  then you'll be surrounded by four imps scratching away at you.
  Kill them and hit the switch, which will raise the floor up so
  you can get the supercharger.

Level 13: Downtown
 1   3 < 5000000,f68b0000> ( 1280, -2421)
  There is a building in the southeast with a switch next to a
  lift.  Hit the switch and take the lift up.  There are two
  doors; the right door won't open.  Take the left one and jump
  across the slime pit to the other side (#1); there's a computer
  map and a chaingun.
 2  74 <fcb00000,f2de0000> ( -848, -3362)
 3  11 < 2e00000,f3d00000> (  736, -3120)
  In the southwest corner of the building in the southwest corner of
  the map is a switch which opens a door leading outside.  There's
  a medikit and some ammo out there (#2).  Just to the east of
  the switch is a stack of crates which you can lower by hitting
  the space bar, revealing another switch.  After you hit the
  switch, you can walk around the stack of crates to your north
  to find a set of stairs leading up to a teleporter.  The teleporter
  takes you to a ledge just west of the starting point (#3).  From
  this ledge, you can run north into the building with the
  supercharger.
 4 108 <fd200000,f7680000> ( -736, -2200)
  The building in the southwest corner of the map has a pit in the
  northwest corner, which leads to a lift.  The lift takes you up
  into another building.  Just across from the lift (to the east)
  is a switch; hitting the switch opens a door revealing some
  shotgun shells (#4).
 5 128 <ffb80000,f7780000> (  -72, -2184)
  The building with the revenants guarding it (the one with the
  blue door at the entrance) contains a crate with a switch on
  the north side.  You can hit the switch to lower the northeast
  platform, so you can get the chainsaw (#5).
 6 166 < 2400000,  d20000> (  576,   210)
  The structure with the red keycard on top of it has a hidden door
  in the middle of the north wall, which can be reached from the
  ground.  The door opens to reveal some blue armor (#6).
 7 213 <ff400000,   40000> ( -192,     4)
  In the northeast corner of the map is a teleporter which takes
  you to the ledge of a building with some imps.  Jump over to
  the ledge of the building just to the west.  There's a door
  there which leads to a teleporter, which takes you to the
  interior of a building farther north, right between two cacodemons
  (#7).  There's a lot of ammo in there too.  Hit space on the inner
  wall to get out.
 8 223 <ffc20000,fc6f0000> (  -62,  -913)
  The building just southeast of the crusher with the plasma gun has a
  door in the south wall with a stairway leading up to a blue door.
  Once you have the blue key, you can enter out and get some ammo and
  rockets (#8).

Level 14: The Inmost Dens
  No official secrets.  One way to get the supercharger is to go to
  the building east of the starting building via the bridge.  Enter
  the building through the south door.  Run out one of the windows
  facing west into the moat, south of the bridge.  Lower the lift
  in the southwest corner, then go through, and go east, kill the
  arachnotron, and get the supercharger.

Level 15: Industrial Zone
 1 290 < 11c0000,  600000> (  284,    96)
  Get the red card key.  Then jump down to the ground, just to the
  east of the platform the red key is on.  There is a beserk box there.
  Hit the space bar on the crate just to your east to lower it, and
  get the stimpack (#1).
 2 276 <fd880000,ff500000> ( -632,  -176)
  Take the teleporter in the southeast corner of the red card key building.
  Walk out onto the ledge, then go to the north end and drop into the
  opening to the west, falling down to the main floor of the building.
  Then walk out the west exit.  Go back and take the teleporter in the
  red card key building again, and walk north and west again; this time,
  the floor has risen up to the level of the ledge on the north side
  of the building.  From here you can jump south onto the platform with
  the ammo and chaingun (#2).
 3 104 < 4c80000,fc800000> ( 1224,  -896)
  Go to the top of the building northeast of the diamond-shaped building.
  Just north of the teleporter is a secret door on the east wall (#3).
  Go through down onto the acid pool; to the north is a backpack and
  some rockets.
 4  53 < b000000,f5800000> ( 2816, -2688)
  Go to the top of the diamond-shaped building on the north shore of
  the acid lake; walk to the south ledge of the building.  Jump south
  down onto the small island with the radiation suit and energy cells.
  (Try walking instead of running.)  Hit the switch, then jump off and
  go northeast to the east side of the lake.  Go through the door you
  find there; through it, you'll find a platform with an
  invulnerability sphere (#4).
 5  70 < 8100000,f3c80000> ( 2064, -3128)
 6  71 < 8100000,f3880000> ( 2064, -3192)
 7  47 < 7c30000,f5360000> ( 1987, -2762)
 8  21 < 5440000,f1040000> ( 1348, -3836)
  In the southeast corner of the map is a building with a spiral
  staircase.  Go up and around the staircase.  As you turn to go
  south, a door will open to the east.  Run south across the lift,
  then east, then run north, jumping across the lower hallway; there
  you'll find an open door (#5) revealing a megasphere (#6).  Now go
  up the stairway again.  As you go south over the lift, a door will
  open up on the north wall, behind you.  Go through the door into an
  area with energy cells and lost souls (#7).  Go east into a small
  opening with a switch.  Hitting the switch will cause a teleporter
  to appear in the hallway to the west.  Enter the teleporter; it will
  take you to a platform in the southwest corner of the building with
  a chainsaw (#8).
 9 147 <  380000,f1e00000> (   56, -3616)
10 216 <fc970000,f5770000> ( -873, -2697)
11 195 <fce00000,f0340000> ( -800, -4044)
  Go the building in the southwest corner of the map.  At the south
  end, you will find some stairs going east (unless you haven't hit
  the switch to raise them).  At the top of the stairs is a secret
  door to the east, revealing a small area (#9) with a teleporter to
  the top of the square spiral staircase building northwest of the
  diamond-shaped building.  I was not able to get credit for secret
  #9, even if I walked into the teleporter; so the most I could get
  for this level is 90% secrets.  Instead of taking the teleporter,
  you could go to the top of the building to the ledge looking north.
  Hit the switch on the west wall, then jump down to the ground and go
  back through the front door of the building.  Go into the acid river
  and follow it north to the lift, which takes you up to another ledge
  where you'll find a plasma gun and ammo (#10).  Now go back to the
  south end of the building and go south through the acid river
  tunnel.  If you got secret #4, there will be a secret door leading
  south in the tunnel (#11) leading to a teleporter to the secret
  level (level 31).

Level 16: Suburbs
 1  41 < 1c00000,fd180000> (  448,  -744)
 2  33 < 1b80000,fe580000> (  440,  -424)
  There are two buildings in the center of the map.  You start in the
  north one; enter the south one.  In the south part of the building
  is a little platform with some shotgun shells on it.  Hit space to
  lower the platform, then get on it.  When you get to the top, shoot
  at the niche in the wall to your east.  A megasphere will be revealed
  in the southeast corner (#1).  (It's easy not to get credit for this
  secret, even if you do get the megasphere.  Walk slowly into and out
  of that corner, making sure you drop into the depression there.)
  Then turn northwest and shoot at the eyes in the wall.  You may need
  to do this while the platform is rising for it to work, or you could
  try using a shotgun.  If you hit it, a door will open just behind the
  wall to your north, containing some ammo (#2).
 3  13 < 6c90000,  800000> ( 1737,   128)
 4   7 < 5310000,fff80000> ( 1329,    -8)
  On the east side of the map is a building with doors on each wall,
  but you can only go through the door in the east wall.  Open the
  east door and enter the building (#3).  Hit space on the northwest
  platform to lower it, then get on.  When it rises back up, walk
  south into the acid pool inside the southwest platform, then hit the
  switch.  The platform will lower, revealing a small room to the
  northwest.  Inside the room is a BFG9000, some energy packs, and a
  medikit (#4).

Level 17: Tenements
 1  48 <fd400000,f5200000> ( -704, -2784)
  Go to the center of the map, then go east until you come to two
  staircases leading north and south.  Lower the lift to your south by
  jumping down in the slime just to the west of it and hitting the
  switch.  Just south of the lift is a hidden room with some armor.
  On the west wall of this room is a lift (#1) leading to a chaingun.
 2  89 <fa900000,fd380000> (-1392,  -712)
  In the north part of the map is an M-shaped structure.  Walk north
  down the middle of the M into the acid lake, then turn around and
  hit space on the wall.  The middle of the M will be lowered, and you
  will see a switch to your south.  Run south and hit the switch.
  (Actually, you don't have to lower the walkway to hit the switch;
  you just have to stand in the right place and press the space bar.)
  A door will be revealed to the east; you can jump into it and get
  some armor (#2) and a BFG9000.
 3 150 <fb040000,f94c0000> (-1276, -1716)
  On the way to the exit, just to the southwest, is a lift.  As you go
  up the lift, you'll notice an opening to the south.  While the lift
  is moving, run into the opening (#3) and into a hallway leading east
  to a megasphere.

 Also, the room with the really annoying stairway north and west
 of the starting point has four teleporters on the floor.  The
 northwest and southeast ones go to the north and south ledges
 where the monsters appear.

Level 18: The Courtyard
 1  17 <f7f40000, 3f60000> (-2060,  1014)
  When you walk around the pillar in the center of the main area, a
  number of doors will open up, including two against the wall west of
  the center pillar.  Of these two doors, the north one leads to a
  BFG9000 and some more monsters (#1).  (The south one has a hall of
  mirrors effect in the door tracks.)
 2  36 <fa050000,ff050000> (-1531,  -251)
  When you walk counterclockwise around the pillar in the center of
  the main area, a door will open up northeast of the pillar leading
  to a teleporter, which takes you to the platform southwest of the
  pillar.  The platform (#2) contains some rockets, health, and blue
  armor.  The teleporter will not be there until you hit the switch
  on the northeast corner of the plus-shaped structure just to the
  south of it (the one containing the cacodemons).
 3  76 < a300000, 4300000> ( 2608,  1072)
  In the northwest corner of the map, hidden between the structures on
  the north and west walls, is a corner with a small bit of grass.
  Walking into the grass teleports you to the northeast corner of the
  map, on a ledge containing a medical kit and a computer map.  (Note
  that the building just to the east of the bit of grass has an
  unclosed sector inside it; you can see out the east wall.)
 4  74 < 8b00000,  940000> ( 2224,   148)
  In the east area of the map is a hallway ending at a blue wall with
  a skull switch.  Hitting the switch opens a hidden door revealing a
  chaingun (#4).

Level 19: The Citadel
 1  43 <fdc20000,ffe20000> ( -574,   -30)
 2  97 <fd860000, 1a00000> ( -634,   416)
 3  95 <fc360000, 1e60000> ( -970,   486)
 4 100 <fa350000, 5a90000> (-1483,  1449)
 5  85 <f9270000, 73c0000> (-1753,  1852)
 6  33 < 6430000, 5300000> ( 1603,  1328)
 7 126 <fdb70000,fc640000> ( -585,  -924)
  In the southwest corner of the main building is a room with a switch
  in the middle which opens doors leading north and south.  Hit the
  switch and go north.  At the intersection, go west, and north
  through the door into a room with health, partial invisibility, and
  lots of imps (#1).  Then go back to the intersection and go north.
  At one point, you'll meet a hallway leading off to the northwest.
  Just south of this hallway on the west wall is a secret door.  (It's
  just north of the place where it LOOKS like there's a secret door.)
  This door leads through a short hallway (#2) to a lift, which leads
  to a hall leading northwest (#3) and stops at a window.  Jump out
  the window to the northwest.  You should be able to reach the steps
  of the building to the northwest (#4).  The building has two
  openings leading inside.  Try the south one first; when you finish
  in there, an area will open up to the northeast with lots of
  troopers and a computer map (#5).  The north opening leads
  (eventually) to five teleporters.  The middle one leads to the
  pillar in the middle of the castle, which contains a rocket
  launcher.  The other four lead to the four corners of the castle.
  Take the northeast one; in the northeast corner of the castle (#6),
  you will find the BFG9000, some demons, and the blue key.  Or, take
  the southwest one; there you will find a chainsaw and the yellow key
  (#7).  An easier way to get to the southwest tower is to go to the
  southwest room of the castle with the doors on the north and south;
  take the south door, and walk down the corridor until you hear a
  door open, then run back and walk through the open door to your left.
 8  38 <ff200000,ffad0000> ( -224,   -83)
 9  52 < 5400000, 1910000> ( 1344,   401)
  In the southeast corner of the map is an area at the top of some
  steps with two things that look like switches to the north.  They're
  not switches, but there's a hidden door between them.  Go through
  the door and up the steps, and hit the switch you see there (on the
  east side of the wall) 3 times.  Then jump down to the north onto
  the platform you've raised up, and from there jump onto the platform
  in the northeast corner of the room.  Go through the teleporter, and
  you'll get a supercharger (#8).  Go south a bit and then north, and
  you'll be teleported to a platform in the southeast area of the
  castle.  Jump to the platform to the northwest (this platform
  appears when you shoot at the imps in the southwest corner; the room
  that they are in is missing its north wall, BTW) and go through the door,
  then down the steps to get the red skull key and some rockets (#9).

Level 20: Gotcha!
 1  56 < 8360000,ee3e0000> ( 2102, -4546)
  The structure just south of your starting point consists of a building
  with a walkway around it to the south entrance.  (The walkway may not
  be there if you have not tried to get to the structure; just walk south
  from the starting point to raise the walkway.)  In the southwest part
  of the "moat" (the poison area between the walkway and the building) is a
  small opening, containing an energy cell pack and a radiation suit (#1).
  Once you have the radiation suit, you can safely walk around the moat
  to the other side, where there is a teleporter leading back to your
  starting point.
 2   4 < ece0000,f5ff0000> ( 3790, -2561)
  At the top of the structure on the east side of the map is a
  teleporter.  (To get there, jump down into the slime just east of
  your starting point and walk north through the little door, up the
  steps (shoot the wall that's in your way), and jump down from the
  window.  Then hit the switch to lower the lift to the entrance of
  the structure, and fight your way up to the top.)  The teleporter
  takes you back to the starting point.  Just to the left of the
  teleporter is a hidden door which takes you through a small room
  (#2) with another teleporter, which goes to a tower on the north
  side of the structure.  In all likelihood, you'll teleport right on
  top of a pain elemental, killing it before it has a chance to fire
  any of those damn skulls.
 3 101 < 5200000,fbf00000> ( 1312, -1040)
  There are two towers west and east of the circular area to the north
  of the main building.  There's nothing on the east one, but the west
  one (#3) has a megasphere on it.  To get there, take the big demon
  teleporter in the circular area.  Walk down the stairs and kill the
  bad guys.  (Note that just south of the stairs, down in the slime,
  is a teleporter leading to the area where the cacodemon was hiding.
  There's blue armor and some health up there.)  Then jump across to
  the dark area east of the stairs.  Instead of walking south to the
  green armor, find the hidden path leading northeast in the dark to
  the teleporter, which takes you to the megasphere.
 4 127 < 2600000,ff180000> (  608,  -232)
 5 132 < 2210000,ff1c0000> (  545,  -228)
 6 128 < 29e0000,ff1c0000> (  670,  -228)
  The structure west of the circular area to the north of the main
  building (not #3--the thing to the northwest of it) has a
  supercharger (#4) and a BFG9000 in it.  To get there, grab a
  radiation suit if you have one, and walk northeast through the slime
  to the building with the teleporter to #3.  Walk around the
  southeast corner of the building, looking for a staircase; there
  should be some flaming skulls there to mark the place.  Walk up the
  stairs to the teleporter, which takes you to the structure to the
  west.  Hit the switch to raise the platform, and kill all the bad
  guys.  If you don't see the BFG9000, shoot your pistol out the east
  window at the big demon teleporter, and a door behind you should
  open revealing the BFG and some ammo.  Then hit the switch on the
  south side of the room to reveal the supercharger (#4).
  Unfortunately, there's a teleporter in the way, which takes you back
  to the demon teleporter; fortunately, there are two secret doors to
  the left and right of the teleporter, which you can take to get to
  the supercharger (through another secret door to its west or east).
  The left one has an arch-vile in it (#5), so I suggest you take the
  right one, which contains an energy cell (#6), unless you want 100%
  kills and secrets; but if you didn't, why would you be reading this?
 7  59 < 6730000,f1270000> ( 1651, -3801)
  In the room with a staircase leading to a plasma gun, there is a
  secret door on the south wall, leading to a small room (#7) with a
  supercharger on the west end.

Level 21: Nirvana
  No official secrets.  To get the megasphere, hit the switch next to
  the teleporter which takes you to the room it's in, then jump in the
  teleporter and run and get it.  Note that the room with the
  arrow-shaped staircase has some weird effects on the ceiling.

Level 22: The Catacombs
 1  85 <fd200000,  f50000> ( -736,   245)
  In the northwest corner of the starting room is a hidden door leading
  to a room with rockets, a supercharger, armor, and a spectre.
 2 125 <fd300000,ff000000> ( -720,  -256)
  In the southwest corner of the starting room is a hidden door which
  leads through a short hallway (#2) to the room you can see to your
  south, containing the plasma gun and an army of chaingunners.
  To open the door, hit space on the green torch.
 3  14 < 3340000, 3a00000> (  820,   928)
  A bit northeast of the red skull key is a secret door leading to a
  small opening (#3) with a teleporter, which takes you to the room south
  of your starting point which contains a plasma gun, in case you hadn't
  already gotten it.

Level 23: Barrels O' Fun
 1  61 <  600000, a700000> (   96,  2672)
  Between the two north-south hallways which lead outside is a third
  hallway containing a megasphere and two boxes of rockets.  It has
  a little outcropping just north of it which you can jump down onto,
  and then walk south to get the goodies.
 2  11 < 81c0000, b780000> ( 2076,  2936)
  In the northeast part of the map are two hallways with boxes and
  boxes of rockets, for use against the various spiders.  In the south
  hallway is a door to the north, leading to a supercharger (#2).

Level 24: The Chasm
 1  98 <ff000000,f8540000> ( -256, -1964)
 2 116 < 1000000,f6870000> (  256, -2425)
  Your starting point is located in a small opening in the north side
  of a building.  The main entrance to the building is around the
  walkway a short distance to the east, but you can't get in, because
  the entrance is too steep.  To raise the stairs up, first fall into
  any of the teleporters in the slime on the floor of the southeast
  corner of the map, north and south of the building you're trying to
  get into.  You should appear south of a series of tower.  Jump down
  from tower to tower, working your way east to a small area with a
  teleporter.  That will take you to another teleporter.  Go straight
  (east) and hit all the switches in that area.  That should raise the
  stairs at the main entrance of the building, so get back there by
  going back to the teleporter, and go through it to the teleporter at
  the base of the series of towers.  Then run west to the teleporter
  on the acid floor.  That will take you back up to the south tower,
  so run northwest to get back to the building near the starting
  point.  Once you get inside (#1), you'll see three things sticking
  out of the north wall.  Hit space on the first one you come to; it
  will lower a lift to your south, which leads to a small area with
  some ammo (#2).
 3  62 <f5400000,fec00000> (-2752,  -320)
  This is the invulnerability in the west part of the map, which is
  not that hard to find; just follow the annoyingly thin walkway west.
  You can jump down onto it, but then you'll be stuck there; you'll
  have to get off that platform and wait for the floor to rise up,
  then walk to one of the surrounding walls, and hit space until you
  get back up to the level of the walkway.  At that point, the
  invulnerability will have worn off.  A better idea is to get a
  radiation suit and jump down into the moat around it, and then hit
  space on the surrounding walls until it reaches the level of the
  platform the sphere is sitting on, then grab it; then the floor will
  raise up to the level of the surrounding walls, and you can get out.
  Or you can try jumping down just to the left or right of the
  invulnerability sphere, enough to get the floor to raise up and take
  away the poison; then grab the sphere, and hit space a few more
  times to get back to the walkway.
 4 123 <fda00000,f1d00000> ( -608, -3632)
  The south area of the map has a shotgun with a small walkway to its
  south.  If you get the shotgun, an opening will appear to the south
  revealing some monsters.  After killing the monsters, you can jump
  down into the opening to get some ammo and health (#4).  When you
  jump back, the floor around the shotgun will rise up and become
  non-toxic.

Level 25: Bloodfalls
 There are no official secrets, but there are some hidden areas.  In
 the north-south hallway with two windows on each side of the hallway,
 in the north part of the map, there is a secret door between the two
 windows on the east side, leading to a rocket launcher and some ammo.
 In the south part of the map, in the room with some steps leading
 south between two windows, there is a hidden room in the northeast
 with a BFG9000; it's on the automap.

Level 26: The Abandoned Mines
 1  29 <  e00000,ffb80000> (  224,   -72)
  When you start the level, there's a secret door right behind you
  (#1) which leads to a big room with lots of bad guys and items.
  The teleporter on the acid floor in the west area of the room
  takes you to a platform where you can jump and get the plasma gun.
 2  34 < 16c0000,  200000> (  364,    32)
  When you start the level, there's a secret door right to the east
  of you (#2).  Hit the switch to lower the room first, then hit space
  on the south part of the east wall.  This door leads to a network
  of tunnels that take you to many of the acid-floored rooms and
  monster ledges that you see from your starting point.
 3  98 <f8380000, 3a00000> (-1992,   928)
 4 121 <fb6c0000, 4e00000> (-1172,  1248)
  The blue keycard has a secret door behind it (#3) revealing a switch
  that lowers two lifts, revealing two areas to the north and south of
  the acid pool to your east, which contain some cacodemons.  The south
  area contains a trigger line that raises the floor near the east door,
  and a switch which opens that door.  The north area contains blue
  armor, and a secret door on the east wall (#4) leading to some
  health potions and a supercharger.

Level 27: Monster Condo
 1  10 <fb5c0000,fea50000> (-1188,  -347)
  When you start the level, the first thing you should do is go through
  the door in the northwest corner of the room (across the acid pool)
  and go west to the lit area with the ammo (#1).  You have 30 seconds
  after the level begins before this area is closed off.
 2 177 < 5f60000,fdad0000> ( 1526,  -595)
 3 171 < 6400000,fbe00000> ( 1600, -1056)
  East of the acid pool with the rocket launcher in the center
  is a west-east dividing wall.  On the east wall, north of the
  dividing wall, is a lit area in the corner.  When you walk into
  this lit area, a door opens to the east revealing an area (#2)
  containing partial invisibility, light amplification, energy
  cells, and lots of monsters.  South of the dividing wall is
  another lit area along the east wall.  When you walk into it,
  a door opens to the east revealing an area (#3) containing some
  ammo, health, shotgun shells, and arachnotrons.
 4  92 < 12d0000, 2f60000> (  301,   758)
 5  93 < 1200000, 4e00000> (  288,  1248)
  In the northeast room with the impaled bodies everywhere, there are
  two switches to the north.  The east one lowers a lift to the
  southwest, which leads to a long corridor of health potions (#4) and
  a teleporter (#5) which takes you up to the ledge in the northeast
  corner of the room, where there's health, armor, ammo, and a BFG.  I
  don't think it's possible to get #5, since the teleporter's sector
  is secret, and you can never enter that sector, because there's the
  teleport line is in the way.  Also note that you can't get out of
  the ledge in the northeast corner unless the door to it has opened
  up already.
 6  45 <f95d0000, 5000000> (-1699,  1280)
 7 129 <f7bd0000,fc400000> (-2115,  -960)
  There are two long north-south skylit rooms with large teleporters
  in the center and pictures of a demon on the north wall.  Each one
  has a switch on the east wall, which you can use to open up the west
  wall in both rooms, revealing some mancubi, a beserk sphere, a
  supercharger, and a computer map in each room (#6 in the north one,
  #7 in the south one).
 8 157 < 4e00000,f7600000> ( 1248, -2208)
  This is the room with the hell knight, just southwest of the
  yellow key, which has the switch that lets you out of the room
  after you get the yellow key.

Level 28: The Spirit World
 1  54 < 3e00000,f1a00000> (  992, -3680)
 2  55 < 5b00000,f1a00000> ( 1456, -3680)
  In the south part of the map is a room with five columns and a
  throne.  Walk up to the throne to lower the middle column, and then
  go stand on it (#1).  (You need to do this in order to complete the
  level, so I don't see why it's a secret.)  When the column raises up
  again, you will see two switches to the north and south.  The south
  one reveals the yellow key.  The north one reveals a passage beyond
  the yellow key, as well as four hell knights, an arch-vile, and
  (fortunately) an invulnerability sphere, some rockets, and a
  teleporter which takes you to the ledge on the east side of the room
  (#2), where you can get another invulnerability sphere and a
  megasphere.
 3  17 <fdc80000,f3c00000> ( -568, -3136)
 4   3 <fea80000,f5a00000> ( -344, -2656)
  In the southwest part of the map is a hallway which leads west and
  then north.  At the bend in the hallway is a small niche to the
  south containing an arachnotron, who will come out and attack you.
  To enter the niche (#3), just walk through the south wall.  There is
  also another niche farther north containing some chaingunners and
  troopers, as well as ammo and health (#4).  Just walk through the
  east wall.
 5  88 < 4240000,ff440000> ( 1060,  -188)
 6  92 < 6440000,  840000> ( 1604,   132)
 7  93 < 6440000, 3dc0000> ( 1604,   988)
  In the northeast part of the map is a room with five columns.  As
  soon as you enter, some hidden doors will open up and lots of
  monsters will come out.  As soon as you kill all the monsters, look
  on the automap, and you will see three secret doors in the niches
  where the monsters were.  The southwest niche has a secret door
  leading east to a supercharger (#5).  The southeast niche has a
  secret door leading north to four backpacks, a medikit, and a
  revenant (#6).  The northeast niche has a secret door leading east
  to a mancubus and a beserker (#7).

Level 29: The Living End
  No official secrets.

  Northwest of your starting point is a path which leads west to a
  teleporter.  As you approach the teleporter, some windows open to
  the north exposing some chaingunners, who promptly attack you.  If
  you walk north off the ledge and then walk west around the structure
  the chaingunners are in, you'll see a small opening leading to a
  teleporter.  This takes you to the ledge the chaingunners are on;
  there's a plasma gun there.

Level 30: Icon of Sin
  The only secret here is how to complete the level.  At the south end
  of the final room is a switch which raises the platform in the lava
  to the north (with the box of rockets).  Hit the switch and wait for
  the platform to go up.  Then go to the platform, hit space to lower
  it, and get on.  Just before it gets to the top, shoot a rocket into
  the exposed brain of the demon.  Then jump down and lower the
  platform again.  This takes about three tries.

Level 31: Wolfenstein
  No official secrets.  However, the room just before the exit door
  has a secret door in the southwest corner, which leads to a small
  niche with a medikit.  The west wall of this niche has another
  secret door which leads to a second exit door; this goes to the
  super-secret level (level 32).  Just south and a bit east of the
  second exit door is a secret door which reveals a supercharger.

Level 32: Grosse
  No official secrets.  However, in the middle of the east wall (the
  middle Swastika) is a hidden door which reveals an invulnerability
  sphere.  The west wall has a hidden door in the same place, leading
  to a bunch of medikits, and a plasma gun with lots of energy cells.
  Also, the two northernmost and two southernmost pillars contain
  various weapons, and a megasphere; walk up to them and hit the space
  bar.

[10-3]: When should I use each weapon?
======================================
FIST:  Never use unless you have Berserk.  This is really cool, but not as
good as the chain saw.

CHAIN SAW:  Good for tight corners.  Rips apart the Demons and Spectres.
This is probably the best weapon for non-shooting enemies.  The chain saw
also works wonders on Cacodemons.  They turn away when you start to chop
them, and cannot fire.

PISTOL:  Average weapon.  Does damage to the Former Humans, but the shotgun is
preferred.  Only to be used when in dire need of ammo.

SHOTGUN:  This is probably the best all around weapon.  Use this much of
the time as it is very powerful.  Its only problem is that its rapid fire
is not very fast.  Very useful in "mazes" where enemies are very close but
not in large amounts.

SUPER SHOTGUN:  Only found in DOOM II, shotgun gurus will love this one.  
Double the power, but uses double the ammo.  Great for taking out those 
hard to kill enemies or many enemies in a group.

CHAINGUN:  This weapon takes a fair amount of time to kill enemies.  Good
for a lot of monsters in a row.  Also very useful for Imps and Cacodemons,
because the chain gun can keep them from firing back.

ROCKET LAUNCHER:  Good for occasional long shots at many enemies in one
place.  Be careful, however, this weapon can hurt you as well if the
rocket bursts at close range.  Very useful in DeathMatch mode. :)

PLASMA RIFLE:  Rapid fires very quickly.  Hurts some enemies a lot, and
others not as much.  Tends to block the view, which is very dangerous when
you have a large amount of enemies coming toward you.

BFG9000:  The most powerful weapon.  Kills almost ANY enemy in one shot,
but uses a lot of energy cells and rapid fire is very slow.

[10-4]: Where can I get each weapon for the first time?
=======================================================
        Here is a chart that shows on which level in each episode you can
pick up each weapon.  This chart is for DOOM I.

                .-----------------------------------.
                | Weapon          | E1M | E2M | E3M |

Note:  This chart pertains to direct hits only.  Missed shots increase the
       amount of ammunition required to kill any enemy.
       The last three columns relate to missiles fired by monsters.  Imps and
       Lost Souls do the same damage as single bullets.

*: Monster only found in DOOM II.

+: This regards a player at 100% strength.  Again, missed shots increase the
   amount.

(10-9): Which enemies will attack each other?
=============================================
        Projectile monster attacks do not hurt other monsters of the same
species. For example, Imp fireballs do not hurt other Imps, but do hurt
other monsters.  Baron green plasma does not hurt other barons, Cacodemon
gasballs don't hurt other Cacodemons, and Cyberdemons are immune to their own
rockets.
        Bullet attacks are fair game for all.  Troopers, Sergeants, and
Spiderdemons all kill their own kind cheerfully.
        Scratching and biting attacks are hard to misdirect but it does
happen, and when it does, Demons will happily go after each other, as will
Spectres.
        Last but not least, Lost Souls who hit each other will duke it out to
the finish.
