CHAPTER [1]: Introduction
-------------------------

*1-1*: A word from Hank Leukart
===============================
        Happy DOOM Birthday!

        It's not often that someone can ask me, "What were you doing at
this very moment, one year ago?" and I would be able to answer.  Today,
December 10th, 1994, is one of those rare occasions in which I know 
exactly.

        Actually, I'm sure if I asked about half the readers of this 
FAQ, they would be able to give me details about their activities too.  
Most of us were sitting on Internet (or using every free moment to log 
on) waiting for DOOM to be released.  I remember staying up most of the 
night, disappointed when it wasn't release by 8am EST.  I waited, 
waited, and waited, until finally everyone located it on "ftp.uwp.edu" 
all at the same time.  Wow!  All the die-hard-DOOM-fans-to-be let out a
sigh of release as the suspense was lifted.

        In retrospect, it has been an incredible experience.  After 11 
revisions and thousands of pieces of E-mail, I'm still alive and sane!  
DOOM has taken up a large portion of my life (it's so addictive) and 
now, here I am, one year, later.

        I hope everyone enjoys this "Anniversary Edition" of the 
"Official" DOOM FAQ v6.666.  It contains DOOM I and DOOM II information, 
the latest on DOOM ports, and all the coolest add-on utilities.

        Now, I have a feeling it's going to all start over again with 
Quake!  Watch for the game in late 1995 from id.  Although this may or 
may not be last "Official" DOOM FAQ, it will definitely be awhile until 
the next revision--this covers just about everything.

        Above all, "Keep on DOOMing!"

        -Hank Leukart

[1-2]: About the "Official" DOOM FAQ
====================================
        Welcome to the post-release v6.666 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  
What does that mean?  Post-release is after the game is released, 
version 6.666 is a standard revision written after 5.8, "Official" means 
absolutely nothing, DOOM is the name of the game, and FAQs are 
[F]requently [A]sked [Q]uestions.
        Here's how revision classification works.  If a new version of
the FAQ only has a small amount of information changed or added, the version
number is increased by 0.1.  This is called a "minor revision."  If a new
version of the FAQ has a substantial amount of new information changed or
added, the version number is increased by 0.5.  This is called a "standard
revision." If a new version of the FAQ has a huge amount of added or changed
information, major parts of the FAQ are rearranged, or major parts of the FAQ
are rewritten, then the version number is increased by 1.0.  This is called a
"major revision."
        You may be wondering why chapter numbers are enclosed in either
[]'s, ()'s, or **'s.  The definition of these is as follows:

        []: Chapters enclosed in brackets mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated in this or the
            previous FAQ.
        (): Chapters enclosed in parenthesis mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated since the previous
            FAQ.
        **: Chapters enclosed in asterisks means that the information
            contained in the chapter is new or has been updated for the
            current version of the FAQ you are reading.

(1-2-1): About the "Official" DOOM ASCII Logos
==============================================
        Thanks to Frans P. de Vries (fpdevries@hgl.signaal.nl), an
incredible ASCII DOOM logo was added to the beginning of the document in
v5.5 of the FAQ.
        The DOOM II logo was added in v6.666 of the FAQ.
        Please keep in mind that, as is rest of this document, the logos
are copyrighted.  This FAQ may not be split into parts and distributed.
Therefore, the logo may not be used independently from the "Official" DOOM FAQ
in any other documents apart from the "Official" DOOM FAQ, the Unofficial
DOOM Specs, and DOOM iNsAnItY.
        Thank you for respecting U.S. and global copyright laws.

[1-6]: Acknowledgments
======================
          I'd like to thank id Software for creating such a GREAT
game!  It definitely exceeds expectations.  I'd also like to thank them
for helping me out, and getting involved with on-line users.  I'd like to
thank the following on-line users for the following reasons:

ID SOFTWARE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:

John Romero (help@idsoftware.com)

        What a guy!  He's been putting up with my infinite
cross-examinations for six months now, and he still hasn't killed me!  He
also read through the ENTIRE FAQ to give me a list of corrections for this
release.  A BIG thanks, John!  (oh yeah, he also programmed that game --
what was it called?! :))

David Taylor (help@idsoftware.com)

        Three cheers for David Taylor!  His once-in-a-while "idNews" Usenet
postings always seem to cut down the amount of E-mail I get for a few
hours.  He also, has put up with me, and answered numerous questions.

Jay Wilbur (help@idsoftware.com)

        You've got to admire this guy.  He puts his life and his family's
life on the line everytime he posts a release date (or "within two weeks")
on Usenet.  He's a great CEO, a great net representative, and handled the
small island travel arrangements at a time in which we thought we might be
pummeled. :)

        And to everyone else at id Software, thanks for a great game!

[1-7]: Accurate Information
===========================
        An attempt has been made to make the information in this FAQ as
accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the game
was recently released, and updates, add-ons, and new information are being
worked on each second, it's hard to keep up.  I had to stop myself from
adding to the FAQ, because if I didn't it would have never been released!
The original press release dated from January 1993 listed a few things that
didn't go in the final game.  Some of those things were impossible to do
after rewriting the 3-D engine 4 times over (for speed and size); other
things just made no sense with the rest of the design.  Trust id Software.
They know what they are doing.  DOOM is one great game!

=====================================
=SECTION ONE= PRELIMINARY INFORMATION
=====================================

--------------------------
CHAPTER [2]: What is DOOM?
--------------------------

        DOOM is a three dimensional, virtual reality type action game
created by id Software.  In some ways, it is similar to Wolfenstein 3-D
(id Software, Apogee).
        In DOOM, you're a space marine, one of Earth's toughest, hardened in
combat and trained for action.  Three years ago you assaulted a superior
officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians.  He and his body
cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home
of the Union Aerospace Corporation.
        The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste
facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.  With no action for
fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' dust and watchin'
restricted flicks in the rec room.
        For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest supplier, has
used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various
secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel.
So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos,
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other.
Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable.
Military "volunteers" entering them have either disappeared or been
stricken with a strange form of insanity--babbling vulgarities,
bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely
death of full-body explosion.  Matching heads with torsos to send home
to the folks became a full-time job.  Latest military reports state
that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is
under control.
        A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos.  "We
require immediate military support.  Something fraggin' evil is coming
out of the gateways!  Computer systems have gone berserk!" The rest
was incoherent.  Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky.
Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been
unsuccessful.
        You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles
were sent up pronto to Phobos.  You were ordered to secure the perimeter of
the base while the rest of the team went inside.  For several hours, your
radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders,
screams, bones cracking, then finally silence.  Seems your buddies are dead.
        Things aren't looking too good.  You'll never navigate off the
planet on your own.  Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by
the assault team leaving you only with a pistol.  If only you could get your
hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on
your way out.  Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in
the forehead.  Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod.  Hopefully you
can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.  As you
walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls
echoing throughout the distant corridors.  They know you're here.  There's no
turning back now.

------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [3]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
------------------------------------------------------------

[3-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC.
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and scanned
textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an environment, makes the
world much more real, thus bringing the player more into the game experience.
Others have attempted this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate,
and seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big improvement
over Wolfenstein 3-D.  With their new advanced graphic development
techniques, allowing game art to be generated much faster, id brings
new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[3-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's
walls are at many angles, and of any thickness.  Walls have see-through
areas, like windows.  This allows more natural construction of levels.  If
you can draw it on paper, you can see it in the game.

[3-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With distance,
your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This makes areas seem huge
and intensifies the experience.  This also creates some amazing effects;
sometimes the lights go out, and you'll have to look for a light switch or
light amplification visors.  Light sourcing allows lamps and lights to
illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe lights to
briefly reveal things near them.  These features make the game
frighteningly real.

[3-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs, poles,
altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great variety for rooms
and halls.
        In DOOM, monsters can be shot on levels that are higher or lower than
you are.  All you have to do is aim horizontally, and DOOM will do the rest!

[3-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it. Radioactive
ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment animation
and morphing.  id Software removed information terminals, access stations,
and wall weapon damaging.  DOOM does include "crushing ceilings," however.

[3-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors), invincibility mode and a few other special effects.

[3-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  DOOM v1.2 supports modem play.
You can see the other player in the environment, communicate with him or her,
and in certain situations you can switch to their view.  This feature, added
to the 3-D realism, makes DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its
release a landmark event in the software industry.  This is the first game to
really exploit the power of LANs and modems to their full potential.  In
1994, id Software fully expects to be the number one cause of decreased
productivity in businesses around the world.  See Chapter [8] for more
information on multi-playing.

[3-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the development end to
provide the smoothest control on the user end.  And the frame rate (the rate
at which the screen is updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to
room, turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky motion of
most 3-D games.  On a 386DX, the game runs well, and on a 486/33, the normal
mode frame rate is almost as fast as television.  This allows for the
most important and enjoyable aspect of gameplay: immersion.

*3-9*: New Monsters and Artificial Intelligence
===============================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed rooms.  When
you open a door, the guards get a chance to see you and opening the door
connects your sound area to the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will
be heard in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this kind of
action.  In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a bunch of
rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast your shotgun and the sound
could travel through a window or slime-river tunnel to another entirely
different area and alert some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking for
you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through slime, etc.  You are
still able to get the drop on them from behind, just like in Wolfenstein
3-D -- but you have to be sneakier about it.
        There is a huge amount of enemies in DOOM and DOOM II.  Here is a
list:

        FORMER HUMANS (dudes in filth-covered combat suits):  Just a few days
ago, you were probably swapping war stories with one of these guys.  Now it's
time to swap some lead upside their head. They are the weakest of all
enemies.

        FORMER HUMAN SERGEANTS (dudes in black armor, also filthy):  
Same as above, but much meaner and tougher.  These walking shotguns 
provide you with a few extra holes if you're not careful!

        IMPS (brown thorny hominids):  You thought an imp was cute 
little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork.  Where did these brown 
bastards come from?  They heave balls o' fire down your throat and take 
several bullets to die.  It's time to find a weapon better than that 
pistol if you're going to face more than one of these S.O.B.s.

        DEMONS (pink horrors, vaguely humanoid):  Sorta like a shaved 
gorilla, except with horns, a big head, lots of teeth, and harder to 
kill. Don't get too close or they'll rip your fraggin' head off.

        SPECTRES (vague, half-formed shapes):  Great.  Just what you 
needed.  An invisible (nearly) Demon.

      + LOST SOULS (flying skulls): Dumb.  Tough.  Flies.  On fire.  
Flying skills with a hot temper.  They like to go for a screaming 
head-on collision.

      + CACODEMONS (gigantic floating one-eyed heads):  They float in the
air, belch ball-lightning, and boast one Hell of a big mouth.  You're toast
if you get too close to these monstrosities.

        BARONS OF HELL (you'll know `em when you see `em):  Tough as a dump
truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since
Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Watch out for the green plasma they fling at you.

      + CYBERDEMON (rocket shooting colossus):  When you get to the end of
the second episode of DOOM, you'll know.  Get ready to see this guy a 
lot more often in DOOM II.

      + SPIDER MASTERMIND (huge robotic chaingun shooting spider):  It 
will make you wish you never were playing DOOM in the first place.  
Watch for it at the end of the third episode of DOOM, and numerous times 
in DOOM II.

      # HEAVY WEAPON DUDE (overweight sergeants with chain guns):  These
guys are probably the first new enemy you will encounter in DOOM II. 
They are more disgusting looking that sergeants, and are also more 
deadly due to their chain gun.

      # HELL KNIGHT (brown colored Baron of Hell):  Slightly easier to 
kill than our friend the Baron, but appear in larger numbers.

      # ARACHNOTRON (toddler version of the Spider Mastermind):  Smaller 
than the Spider Mastermind, and a lot harder to kill, but there are a 
lot more of these guys.  Watch for its BFG9000-like green plasma.

      # PAIN ELEMENTAL (even more disgusting huge Cacodemon-like blobs):  
Watch out for these guys, they fly around and fire Lost Souls at you.  
If you don't kill them quick enough, the Lost Souls will eat you for 
lunch.

      # REVENANT (skeletons with a bad temper):  These huge skeletons 
are just cruel.  They punch and kick the life out of you, and also enjoy 
launching flaming rockets into your torso.

      # MANCUBUS (overweight walking blob with guns for arms):  He is 
fat, ugly, and like shooting enormous fireballs into you from his arms.

      # ARCH VILE (flaming spirits):  Not only does he summon the fire 
elementals to watch you go up in flames, he revives already dead demons 
while he's at it.

+:  Not found in the shareware version of DOOM
#:  Only found in DOOM II


*3-10*: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that are in DOOM.  Don't try using these at
home. :)

        (1) Fist
        (2) Chain Saw
        (3) Pistol

#: Denotes a weapons found only in DOOM II.

[3-10-1]: What does BFG9000 stand for?
--------------------------------------
        Being the most powerful weapon, the only thing BFG9000 could stand
for would be "Big Fraggin' Gun." :)

------------------------------
CHAPTER [4]: Who created DOOM?
------------------------------

        DOOM was created by id Software, and is also published by

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]: What are the differences between the different releases of DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

(5-1): What is the shareware release?
=====================================
        The shareware version of DOOM only includes one of the three
missions of DOOM.  Each mission contains eight levels and a secret
level.  The shareware version contains network support and modem
support.  The shareware version does NOT include the Plasma Rifle and
the BFG9000 weapons. On December 10th, 1993, v1.0 was released.  On
December 16th, 1993, v1.1 was released.  On February 17th, 1994, id
released v1.2 of DOOM.  This version fixed many bugs and added new
features, including modem support. Unfortunately, this revision added
many new bugs.  On June 28th, 1994, v1.4 was released.  This version was
only an "Internet Beta version," as was used to find bugs before the
pending released of v1.5 of DOOM.  Then, on July 8th, 1994, v1.5 was
released as another "Internet Beta version."  Both version 1.4 and 1.5
were released without registered version patches. In early August, v1.6
was released as yet another "Internet Beta version." FINALLY! In early
September of 1994, v1.666 made its debut!  The new features of v1.4,
v1.5, and v1.666 are all outlined in Chapter [5-3].

[5-2]: What is the mail-order release?
======================================
        The mail-order release of DOOM includes all three missions of DOOM.
Each mission contains eight levels and a secret level.  This version includes
all weapons.  All mail-order releases ordered July of 1994 are older
versions.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you wish modem
support, Nightmare mode, DeathMatch v2.0, and various other bug fixes.

[5-3]: What makes the six versions different?
=============================================
        Seven different versions of DOOM have been released: v1.0 (which
has the v0.99 operating system), v1.1, v1.2, v1.4, v1.5, v1.6, and
v1.666.  Version 1.0 was the initial December 10th, 1993 release.
Version 1.1 was the first upgrade of DOOM, released on December 16th,
1993.  Although this version fixed many bugs and compatibility problems,
it introduced many new ones. Version 1.2, released on February 17th,
added modem play, Nightmare mode, and better use of networks, but again
introduced many new bugs.  v1.4 of DOOM was a Beta version released
exclusively on the Internet, and was only used for finding bugs before
the pending v1.5 release.  v1.5 followed, which again was released as an
Internet Beta version to find bugs for the pending v1.6.  v1.6 was then
released as another Beta, and finally v1.666 was released in early
September which fixed some modem play problems and other miscellaneous
sound code and control bugs.
        Note: id reports that v1.8 of DOOM will be released in the near 
future, and DOOM II has a version v1.7 and v1.7a.

        v1.4/v1.5/v1.666 new features:

        - New 14.4k and 28.8k modem support
        - Better serial support
        - New and improved SETUP.EXE with the following features:
                + Phone number list
                + Modem string database
                + Level warp key (F1)
                + Up to eight digital channels instead of four
        - New DeathMatch v2.0 rules (-ALTDEATH parameter):
                + All objects respawn after 30 seconds
                + Suicide subtracts a frag from your score
                + Negative frags are now possible
        - You can type "+" and "-" in chat mode
        - The "Official" DOOM FAQ is now included
        - Microscopic map bugs fixed and some elements changed in certain
          maps for network play
        - Recording multiplayer demos is now possible
        - Recorded demos do NOT end when you die or when the level ends.
          You must press "Q" or quit from DOOM to halt recording.  The
          default demo buffer is 128K, but it can be increased by using
          the "-MAXDEMO <#k>" command-line parameter.  "-MAXDEMO 1024"
          would allocate one megabyte for a demo recording buffer!
        - When playing back Multiplayer demos, you can use F12 and TAB
          keys to access the other player's views and watch everyone
          on the automap.
        - You can NOT use external files with the shareware version any
          longer.  You must register first.
        - You can now reload maps using the IDCLEV<e#><m#> cheat if you are
          map editing on a LAN
        - Supports RESPONSE files for up to 100 command-line arguments.  A
          response file is a text file that contains all the command-line
          arguments you which to pass to DOOM.  An example would be:

            ---- start of file ---- (don't type this line)
            -nomonsters
            -deathmatch
            -altdeath

            ---- end of file ---- (don't type this line)
          If you name this file RESPONSE.TXT, when you invoke DOOM, you
          would type "DOOM @RESPONSE.TXT" and add any additional
          command-line parameters afterwards.
        - Sound Blaster AWE32 sound support
        - Sound does NOT work under Windows or OS/2 yet.  A new version is
          being test and will be released when it is stable.
        - new FAST parameter allows optional fast enemies
        - new TURBO parameter allows the marine to move more quickly
          (this is considered cheating and is only meant for DeathMatch play)
        - the DEVPARM parameter is no longer needed to record demos

        NOTE: Saved games from versions before v1.666 do not work with v1.666.

        Bug fixes since v1.5:

        - Miscellaneous sound code, serial code, and control fixes
        - IDKFA and shotgun no longer crashes the game

        Bug fixes since v1.4:

        - SERSETUP has been rewritten-- AGAIN!
        - Help screen now mentions F11:Gamma Correction.
        - Sprite graphics can now be used in PWADs.
        - A bug that caused some monsters to teleport outside of the levels
          has been corrected.
        - Mysterious DeathMatch bug (since v1.0) that caused random objects
          to reappear but not be gettable has been corrected.
        - Increased 64K of savegame buffer space for PWAD developers.
        - SERSETUP COM port setting > 38400 has been fixed.
        - Response file bug fixed.
        - SETUP lets you type ENTER for a control key.
        - New GUS instrumnet mapping file for 1mb GUS cards only.

        Bug fixes since v1.2:

        - Now more than two people can play over a network without crashes.
        - No more PS/2 mouse bug (player loses control of character,
          character spins, game locks, etc.)
        - Saving a game under a open door, restoring it, then pressing
          space no longer causes the game to crash.
        - Sound code rewritten.
        - Serial game difficulty selection fixed in SETUP.EXE.
        - map bug fixes including two-sided linedef bug and faulty
          SKY1 ceiling texture mapping
        - gun projectiles (rockets, plasma, rockets) will no longer trigger
          linedefs

        It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you have not already
done so.

(5-4): What is the commercial release?
======================================
        The commercial version of DOOM is called "DOOM II: Hell on
Earth" and is now available in stores!
        DOOM II is finished and is now available to registered users of
the original DOOM.  It can be ordered directly from id or from GT
Interactive Software at 1-800-332-4300.  It costs $44.95 per copy.
        DOOM II includes these features:

        * 30 levels plus 2 secret levels
        * Lots of graphics
        * All new music
        * More sound effects
        * Runs a little faster than original DOOM due to further code
          optimizations!
        * New enemies
        * Totally killer DeathMatch-designed levels!

[5-5]: I bought DOOM in a store, is it illegal?
===============================================

        Here is accurate information regarding DOOM's legality.

        (1) DOOM purchased directly from (800)-ID-GAMES is NOT illegal.
        (2) The registered version of DOOM purchased in ANY retail stores
within the United States is illegal.
        (3) The registered version of DOOM purchased on CD-ROM ANYWHERE
is illegal.
        (4) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores
OUTSIDE of the countries listed below is illegal.

                Australia
                New Zealand
                Hong Kong
                Taiwan
                Singapore
                Netherlands
                UK

        (5) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores in
Canada is illegal.
        (6) The shareware version of DOOM purchased anywhere (on CD-ROM

please E-mail to "help@idsoftware.com" to report the distributor,
date of purchase, and price.  Calling (800)-388-PIR8 is also allowable
for people without Internet access.

        None of this information applies to DOOM II, which is sold in 
stores.

(5-6): What is WinDOOM?
=======================

        Here is the latest information on WinDOOM, direct from Microsoft.

- WinDOOM is a joint effort of id Software and Microsoft.  Microsoft is doing
  most of the porting work.
- WinDOOM is a Win32 application.  It runs under Windows NT and Windows 4.0.
- WinDOOM uses the recently announced WinG libraries.
- WinDOOM supports full music and sound and supports all Windows MIDI and
  WAVE devices.

  performed via "stretching" (this is a limitation of the DOOM engine)
- WinDOOM supports network play via WinSOCK (TCP/IP) and NetBIOS (NetBeui,
  IPX, etc.)
- WinDOOM supports any display with at least 256 colors.
- WinDOOM is multithreaded so if you're running under a multiprocessor
  machine you'll see a significant speed increase.
- WinDOOM will support DEC Alpha and MIPS RISC machines.

*5-7*: What other DOOM ports are in the works?

"dm1666.zip".  The 1.44mb file names are "dm1666a.zip" and 
"dm1666b.zip." If you got DOOM before September of 1994, it is 
recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you wish all of its new 
features and bug fixes. A patch under the file name "dm1666sp.zip" is

under the file name "dm1666rp.zip" is available to upgrade the 
registered version to v1.666.  Additionally, a file named "altdoom1.zip" 
is available for those people whose computers do not work with the DOOM 
DOS Extenders, but only for DOOM v1.1. NOTE: Registered version patches 
for v1.4, v1.5, and v1.6bt were NEVER released.
        There is NO shareware version of DOOM II, however, there are 
patches to upgrade DOOM II to v1.7a.  These are available under the file

----------------------------------------
CHAPTER [7]: What is needed to run DOOM?
----------------------------------------

*7-1*: What is REQUIRED to run DOOM?
====================================
        DOOM requires a 386sx IBM compatible computer running MS-DOS v3.3 or
higher, VGA (320x200x256) graphics, and 4mb of RAM.  The shareware version of
DOOM needs about 4.8mb of hard drive space.  The mail-order version needs
about 12mb of hard drive space.
        DOOM II requires a 486 with at least 17mb of hard drive space.  
I have seen it RUN on a 386, but it runs too slow.
        DOOM ports for the Atari Jaguar, Linux/X, Irix/X, Windows, OS/2 PM,
MacOS, SEGA 32X (Mars), QNX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and UNIX are also planned.

*7-2*: What sound cards does DOOM support?
=========================================
        DOOM supports general MIDI, Adlib, Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro,
Sound Blaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas, Gravis UltraSound, WaveBlaster, Pro
Audio Spectrum 16, Sound Blaster AWE-32, and compatibles.

[7-3]: What game controllers does DOOM support?
===============================================
        DOOM supports keyboard, mouse, joystick, and trackball (functioning
as a mouse).
        DOOM also supports the Gravis Gamepad and Logitech Cyberman.

----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [8]: How can I use multiple players in DOOM?
----------------------------------------------------

        DOOM supports 2-4 players in a multi-player mode. DOOM is
playable over networks, modems and by serial link.

Note: For playing the registered DOOM over networks or by modem, EACH user
      MUST BUY his/her own individual copy of the game.

[8-1]: How does the multi-player gameplay work?
===============================================
        In DOOM, players are able to see each other, and watch each other
jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players are able to watch
others get hurt, die, and move throughout the labyrinth.  DOOM allows
players to play together, working as a team.  In this cooperative mode,
players can see each other on an "automap" and switch to each other's view.
DOOM also allows players to play against each other, in DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-1]: How does pausing, saving, and loading work?
====================================================
        In DOOM, some things change when playing with more than one player.
        When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the game KEEPS
RUNNING so that other players can continue with the action.  So, it is best
to find a safe place before adjusting screen size, sound, etc.
        A player may pause the game by pressing the PAUSE key, but any other
player can unpause the game by pressing the PAUSE key again.  Make sure it is
okay with your buddies before taking a breather.
        When you do a save game during network/modem play, it saves on every
player's system in the save game slot you select, writing over whatever was
there.  Before saving the game, players should agree on a safe slot to save
it in.
        You cannot load a saved game while playing a multi-player game. To
load a game, everyone must quit from the current game and restart the game
from a saved game.  To start a game from a saved game, you can either
select it from the SETUP program or identify it as a command line parameter.

[8-1-2]: What are the different uniform colors for?
---------------------------------------------------
        In network/modem games, each player's uniform is a different color.
The color of your character is the color behind your face on the status bar.
The colors are BROWN, INDIGO (black), GREEN, and RED.
        These are used to identify between players during game play, and
to chat with others using Chat Mode.

[8-1-3]: How does a player see what others are doing?
-----------------------------------------------------
        If you're playing in cooperative mode, press F12 to toggle through
the other players' viewpoint(s).  You still retain your own status bar at
the bottom, and if your view reddens from pain it is YOU, not your partner,
who has been hit.

[8-1-4]: How do players communicate using Chat Mode?
----------------------------------------------------
        In a multi-player game you can communicate with other players in the
Chat Mode.  To enter into Chat Mode and broadcast a message to all the other
players, press the letter "T".  A cursor will appear where your messaging is
normally placed.  To broadcast to a specific player, instead of pressing
"T", you'll need to press the first letter of the player's color: (B)rown,
(I)ndigo, (G)reen, and (R)ed.  For example, to send a message to the brown
character, you would press the letter "B".
        In DOOM v1.2, a macro capability was added.  After defining
ten macros in SETUP.EXE, pressing the player color, and then
"ALT-<macro number>" will send a macro.

[8-1-5]: How do the weapons work?
---------------------------------
        When a player runs over a weapon, he picks it up, but the weapon
remains in the game for other players to take.  Shotguns dropped by former
human sergeants are removed from the game after being picked up or smashed.
        In DeathMatch v2.0 (use the ALTDEATH parameter), weapons are
removed from the playing field from thirty seconds and then reappear when
playing DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-6]: What happens when a player dies?
-----------------------------------------
        If you die and restart in the level, previously taken items and
destroyed monsters don't reappear unless you are playing in DeathMatch
v2.0.  Even though you've died, other players have survived.

[8-1-7]: Can players exchange supplies?
---------------------------------------
        Players cannot exchange supplies.

[8-1-8]: Miscellaneous
----------------------
        In Cooperative mode, each player begins in the same area.  In
DeathMatch mode the players begin in completely different areas--if you want
to see your buddy you'll need to hunt him down.  Plus, each time you die,
you'll start in one of several random locations.
        Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, in DeathMatch
mode the players start at each location with the keys necessary for opening
any locked door in that area.
        In DeathMatch mode the ARMS section on the status bar is replaced
with "FRAG."  The FRAG section displays the number of times you've killed
your opponents.
        In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way it does in
single-player mode.  Each player is represented by a different color arrow.
In DeathMatch mode you won't receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on
the map.  Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around the
corner, and you won't know it until you face them.

[8-2]: What exactly is "DeathMatch" mode?
=========================================
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level is infested with enemies and power-ups.
In this mode, players can't see the other players in the Automap, nor switch
to their view.  Players are not able to view other's health in the mode,
because of the disadvantage this can cause.

[8-3]: How does DOOM work with networks?
========================================
        DOOM supports the IPX (Novell Netware) protocol in the initial
shareware version.  Using this network support, DOOM can be played in a
workplace type environment.
        To start network mode:
        (1) Launch DOOM from the SETUP program, by going to the directory in
which you installed DOOM, typing SETUP, and pressing the ENTER key. Unlike
playing DOOM in single player mode, DOOM in multi-player mode must be run
either from the SETUP program or by using the command line parameters.
        (2) The SETUP program allows you to configure the information that
is necessary for the multi-player game. The SETUP is simple to use.
        (3) Start the game!

(8-3-1): What are the network command line parameters for DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------
-LOADGAME allows you to start DOOM from a specified save game.  Instead of
using the saved game name, simply enter the number (0-5) that corresponds to
the slot you saved the game to on the SAVE GAME screen.
-loadgame <# of the game>

-DEATHMATCH starts DOOM as a DeathMatch game.  If you don't enter DEATHMATCH
as a command line parameter, DOOM will default to Cooperative mode.
-deathmatch

-SKILL sets the skill level (1-5) you wish to play.
-skill <# of skill level>

-EPISODE sets the episode (1-3) you wish to play.  The default episode is
Episode One, Knee-Deep in the Dead.
-episode <# of the episode>

-CONFIG allows you to use your configuration file from any directory you
choose.
-config <pathname> ex. -config f:\doom\data\myconfig.cfg

-NOMONSTERS allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running around!
This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters just get in the
way.
-nomonsters

-RESPAWN tells DOOM that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, you want all the
monsters to respawn 8 seconds after you kill them.  The NIGHTMARE skill
level already does this.  Note that using -respawn and -nomonsters at the
same time is a dumb thing to do.
-respawn

-ALTDEATH uses DeathMatch v2.0 mode.
-altdeath

-FAST uses fast monsters, as in Nightmare mode
-fast

-MAXDEMO determines the maximum size of a recorded demo
-maxdemo <size in K>


-TURBO increases the speed of the marine (this is considered cheating in
single player mode and is meant for DeathMatch only)
-turbo <speed increase 1-255>

[8-3-2]: How does DOOM determine player colors?
-----------------------------------------------
        The player numbers and colors are determined by the ethernet node
address. The lower the number, the lower number you will be assigned in a
multi-player game.   The lowest number gets green, and the highest number
(with four players) gets red.  To change the player numbers in a net game,
insert the line :"NODE ADDRESS xxxxxxxxxxxx" under the Link Driver section of
your net.cfg before you load LSL.

[8-3-3]: How can I use DOOM on Novell Netware Lite?
---------------------------------------------------
        Hwere is information on how to play DOOM on a Novell Netware Lite
network.  Novell does not approve of or recommend the following drivers.

HOST/CLIENT (1) Load the LSL.  (LSL.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (2) Load your card driver.  (example: 3C5X9.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (3) Load your server.  (SERVER.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (4) Load your client.  (CLIENT.COM)
CLIENT      (5) Log into the network.
CLIENT      (6) Map the hosts to the hard drive.  (refer to NWL Manual)
HOST        (7) Run DOOM's SETUP.EXE, configure, and press F10.
CLIENT      (8) Change to mapped DOOM directory, and run SETUP.EXE,
                using the same options as used on the host.
            (9) PLAY DOOM!

Note: It is illegal to use the Registered DOOM on only one server.  You
      must buy a seperate copy of the game for each player.

[8-3-4]: How can I use DOOM on other types of networks?
-------------------------------------------------------
        It does not matter what type of network you use for DOOM, whether it
is Lantastic, Windows for Workgroups or other networks.  netDOOM uses the
cards at such a low level that it does not need the network services.  It
only needs the ODI/IPX drivers.
        This being the case, netDOOM works fine with any Ethernet or any
other cabling system. Naturally, you can not use any normal network services
at the same time.

        There are a number of ways of getting IPX working with a given
ethernet card.  One is to use a dedicated IPX driver for the card,
another is to run an IPX converter over some other standard such as
NDIS, ODI, or the packet driver standard.  If one method fails to
work, try another one!  I have had good reliability with the IPX
over Packet driver method, though it can sometimes be a challenge
to get it running...  If you are already using Novell, then the IPX
over ODI might be simpler to set up, though I have found it less
reliable.

        Before I get going, let me plead with everyone NOT TO USE DOOM 1.1
OR 1.0 ON ANY NETWORK OTHERS ARE TRYING TO USE!!  Doom 1.666 is now
available, so please use it rather than 1.1 or 1.0.  DOOM 1.0 and
1.1 really screw up networks.

Now that I have all my disclaimers out of the way... :)

        To use this method of installing IPX you need two files, both of
which are in the file PKTD11.ZIP, which can be had from
oak.oakland.edu as/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip.  I have seen some
problems with this version (11) of the drivers, however, so it
would be wise to test out the packet driver after it is loaded, or
perhaps to try one which comes direct from the ethernet card
manufacturer. (i.e. 3c5x9pd.com from ftp.3com.com)

        If you have problems with these drivers, I have put together a
collection of older versions of IPX and packet drivers which seem
to work better with DOOM.  This package will be uploaded to
ftp.uwp.edu as OLDIPX.ZIP.  (see Chapter [14-6])

        The first file is specific to your ethernet hardware.  It is the
packet driver software that converts packet-driver calls to
commands your ethernet card can understand.  The INSTALL.DOC file
included with the packet driver collection has details about which
cards are supported and what sort of command-line parameters are
needed for each packet driver.  I always load the packet driver
using interrupt 0x60, a popular convention.  These drivers will not
work well under Windows without tweaking, so read the INSTALL.DOC
file for details.  There are also some useful packet utilities
included.  Again details are in INSTALL.DOC.  (Got the hint yet? :)

EXAMPLES:

     3Com 503 card on interrupt 5, I/O port 0x300, and the
     internal transceiver. (twisted pair RJ-45 connector ON
     THE CARD or coaxial BNC connector-- NOT the 15-pin AUI
     connector) The shared memory area is automatically
     determined-- but be sure to exclude the region from your
     expanded memory manager, if used!

          3C503.COM 0x60 0x5 0x300 1

     3Com 509 card: These cards are entirely
     software-configurable through the config/diagnostics on
     your EtherDisk that came with the card.  If you have lost
     the disk, all the needed files are available from
     ftp.3com.com.

          3C509.COM 0x60

     AT&T StarLan cards: Almost like the 503 except the memory
     location must be specified.

          AT&T.COM 0x60 0x2 0x360 0xD000

        Once the packet driver is loaded and reports things correctly
(i.e. it does not give your ethernet address as
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF...) then just run PDIPX.COM to load IPX support.
The PDIPX.COM program is included with PKTD11.ZIP, but it is
contained in a .ZIP file INSIDE of PKTD11.ZIP called PDIPX103.ZIP.
Run the .COM file with no parameters.

        If you have problems with an "invalid mode" when loading PDIPX, you
probably are trying to run other network software at the same time
as the Packet Driver/IPX combination.  Strip down your CONFIG.SYS
and your AUTOEXEC.BAT files to those shown below.  Do not load any
additional TSR's!  Once this bare-bones configuration works, you
can begin adding TSR's.  if your problems persist, try using the
older versions of the packet driver and IPX-to-PD converter.  (They
should be on ftp.uwp.edu.)

        If nothing seems to work, try running the diagnostic program
PKTWATCH.COM after getting everything set up.  If your screen fills
with scrolling multicolor hexadecimal numbers then the packet
driver is working OK.  If it just flashes a cursor at you, then you
have problems UNLESS you are wired directly to another computer.
Hook your computer back up to an active network and see if you can
receive anything then.  If you do not have an active network
available, start DOOM on the OTHER computer while running PKTWATCH
on the original computer.  Of course, the other (sending) computer
needs to have IPX set up as well.

        The simplest way to get all the drivers you need loaded and to
exclude other drivers which may interfere is to create a boot disk
with the correct startup files.  For example:

     CONFIG.SYS
          device=a:\himem.sys
          dos=high,noumb
          files=30
          buffers=30

     AUTOEXEC.BAT
          prompt [DOOM Setup] $p$g
          a:\3c503.com 0x60 0x5 0x300 1
          rem change the above according to your card.
          a:\pdipx.com

        The ONLY line that will vary with what card you have is the
"3c503.com" line.  I encourage you NOT to load an EMS driver since
so many cards use shared memory and it is sometimes difficult to
ensure that the proper area, and only the proper area, is excluded.
DOOM runs just fine with XMS, and you have the added benefit of
loading DOS high to make room for things like mouse drivers.  DOOM
does not NEED XMS to run, though.  Also, I like to change the DOS
prompt to reflect my configuration whenever I am using a bizarre
setup.

        It might be a good idea to also scan your bootable floppy for
viruses BEFORE booting the networked computer with it.  (Scan it on
the NETWORKED computer, not your own...)  There are a number of
common viruses spread by booting computers from infected disks.
(Stoned, Form, and Michelangelo to name a few.)  Let's not give
DOOM a bad name by booting network computers from infected disks!
(btw, F-prot from oak.oakland.edu as /pub/msdos/virus/fp-211.zip is
an EXCELLENT antivirus program. <plug>)

        You must make sure that all of the networked computers using DOOM are
using the same frame type.

[8-3-5]: How can I set up a small inexpensive DOOM network?
-----------------------------------------------------------
        All that is required for network play is a network card for each
computer, a T-plug for each computer (usually supplied with your network
card), and some cable.  A server is not necessary.  Here is a good supply of
inexpensive eight bit network cards for DOOM play.

Corporate Systems Center                PHONE: (408)-734-DISK
1294 Hammerwood Avenue                    FAX: (408)-745-1816
Sunnyvale, CA 94089

        Brand new 16-bit cards priced at only US$49.00 each.  When calling,
tell your service person that you would like to run DOOM.  Corporate Systems
will send you the cards mentioned here.

[8-4]: How can I play DOOM by serial link?
==========================================
         DOOM works in two player mode by modem or null modem.  The
minimum baud rate to play DOOM is 9600 bps.
        Shareware versions 1.0 and 1.1 do NOT support play by modem or
serial link.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 of DOOM.
        Using this mode is similar to network mode.
        To use a serial link connection, run the DOOM setup and choose "Run
Network/Modem/Serial Game."  Then, choose the type of connection you plan
to make.  Then, configure the game to your liking, and choose the connect
method.
        Note that to run null-modem game, you must have a null-modem cable
plugged into a serial port on both computers and each computer runs
SETUP.EXE with identical parameters.
        If you are using a modem, you will most likely need to edit the
MODEM.CFG file in the DOOM directory.  The first line of the file is an
initialization string.  Pull out your modem manual, and do the following.

        (1) Find the code that turns off error correction.
        (2) Find the code that turns off data compression.
        (3) Find the code that locks your modem at 9600 baud.
        (4) Find the code that turns off all hardware and software flow
            control.
        (5) Create an "AT" initialization string with all these codes and
            put it into the MODEM.CFG.

        To find an already created initialization string for your modem, look
in Chapter [18-3] of this FAQ.  If one is not listed for your modem, you will
have to dig up your modem manual for the correct settings.
        The second line is a hangup string used when you quit DOOM.
        If you STILL cannot get the modems to connect, both of you should
run your favorite terminal programs, and connect with 9600, no error
correction, no data compression, and NO HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL.  Then just run
SETUP.EXE with the "Already Connected" option in the configuration box.

[8-5]: How can I play DOOM over the Internet?
=============================================

(8-5-1): How can I play DOOM using IHHD?
----------------------------------------
        Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by Jim
Knutson.  With this brilliant little piece of code, multiplayer gaming has
soared to new heights.  With IHHD, you'll be able to play Head to Head
against other human opponents all over the world, with the only cost to you
being the regular prices you pay to connect to or use your Internet host.
Best of all, it's free.

        First of all, your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  If you aren't sure what your host is running for its operating
system, check the information given at the login prompt or send mail to
your administrator.

        Other than that, you should be able to run IHHD with ease.  Your
first order of business is to get the IHHD software.  It is available via
anonymous FTP at "rex.pfc.mit.edu" in the "pub/IHHD/src" directory.

        To get it:

        (1) FTP to rex.pfc.mit.edu  ("ftp rex.pfc.mit.edu" at UNIX prompt)
        (2) At the login prompt, enter "anonymous"
        (3) At the password prompt, enter your E-mail address
        (4) At the command prompt, type "cd pub/IHHD/src"
        (5) Type "binary"
        (6) Type "get dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (7) Type "bye"

        If you followed the above steps, you should now have the
"dialer1.6.4.shar" file in your home directory.  Type "ls" at your host's
command prompt to verify its existence.  If you don't see it, try the
above steps again or call for help.

        Next, if you've successfully retrieved the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file
from the FTP site, you need to prepare the IHHD to run on your UNIX system.
For UNIX veterans, the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file is in fact a shar file, and
contains a makefile for easy compiling on your system.  For the rest of
us, follow these steps to get the IHHD up and running:

        (1) Create a directory to put the IHHD software in.
            Type "mkdir IHHD" at the command prompt.
        (2) Move the IHHD file to the new directory.
            Type "mv dialer1.6.4.shar IHHD"
        (3) Go to the IHHD directory.
            Type "cd IHHD"
        (4) Unpack the IHHD files.
            Type "sh dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (5) Compile the IHHD software to run on your system.
            Type "make"
        (6) You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory.
            The important filenames you're looking for should be:
                "dialer"
                "tcpdialer"
                "tcpanswer"
                "call"
                "showlog"
        (7) If you've got these, you're cool.  Otherwise, try the above
            steps again, re-retrieve the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file from
            "rex.fpc.mit.edu" using the instructions above, or call for help.

If everything checks out, you're ready to rumble!

Here's how you get connected using IHHD:

        (1) Set up a time to play with another Internet DOOM player.
            Ideally, you should use E-mail to make the prior arrangements.

            Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate and line
            settings for your modems.

            Make sure data compression, error correction, and hardware
            flow control on your modem are off.  Look at the modem
            initialization strings section in this FAQ for more help.

        (2) When it's time to play, start your favorite terminal program
            and call up your Internet host using your modem.  Make sure that
            your baud rate and line settings correspond to your opponent's.

        (3) Login to your Internet host normally.

        (4) Contact the other player by sending a short E-mail message
            indicating that you are on the net and ready to play.

        (5) Once you both establish that you're there and ready to go,
            return to your UNIX prompt.

        (6) Type "cd IHHD" to enter your IHHD directory.

        (7) You may have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it
            activated already.

        (8) Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection.
            For example, if you were playing against knuston@cactus.org,
            you would type "dialer cactus.org" to initiate the connection.

            Another way is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
            opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Or reverse roles, where
            you type "tcpdialer -answer" while your opponent types "tcpdialer
            your.host".  Don't ask me what the difference is; I don't know.

            So, to recap, there are two methods of IHHD connection.
            Method 1: dialer.  You each type "dialer other.guy's.host"
            Method 2: tcpdialer.  One of you types "tcpdialer other.guy's.host"
                      while the other types "tcpdialer -answer".

        (9) Regardless of which method you use to connect, type short text
            messages followed by a carriage return until you see your opponent
            acknowledge you.  Unless you have "local echo" set to ON in your
            serial settings, you will not see the text you type.

       (10) If you don't see your opponent after a reasonable amount of time,
            exit dialer or tcpdialer by pressing "CTRL-C" (i.e. hitting
            the "CTRL" and "C" key simultaneously.)  Contact your opponent
            again by E-mail and agree to try the other method of
            connecting.

       (11) If you're connection looks fine and your opponent has acknowledged
            you and you have acknowledged him, exit your terminal program
            and change to your DOOM directory.  Run SETUP.EXE, and select
            "Run Network/Modem/Serial Game."  On the next menu, choose
            "Modem."  Finally, configure all of the options to your liking,
            select "Already Connected," and press F10.

       (12) If everything goes well, DOOM will start up and bring you to
            your first game over the Internet!  Congratulations, you are
            now connected by IHHD.  You can now proceed to play DOOM as if
            you were connected via a regular phone line.

        If you are having trouble getting DOOM to work with your modem, you
may want to download one of the many third-party serial drivers for DOOM.
(see Chapter [15])

        Unfortunately, because of the nature of the Internet, delays and
warping may occur with your IHHD connection, depending on the quality of the
connection between your and your opponent's host machines.  These delays
are often sporadic, and depend largely on what's going on on the Internet
at that particular times.  Then again, you might just be extremely unlucky
and have a cruddy Internet connection.

        To gauge the quality of the connection, try to "ping" your opponent's
computer from your host.  At the UNIX prompt, type "ping -s opponent's.host".
You should get a listing of "ping times", which you may stop at any time by
pressing "CTRL-C".  Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of
how much ping times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of the
connection between your host and your opponent's.

        Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got a
cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've got a good
connection.

        If all else fails, burn incense and sacrifice a beautiful young virgin
princess to the net.gods.  No, wait.  Better yet, send me a virgin.  E-mail
me for an address.

*8-5-2*: How can I play DOOM using iDOOM?
-----------------------------------------

                    The TCP/IP Internet DOOMer's FAQ
                    by Scott Coleman (asre@uiuc.edu)
                  and Jay Cotton (jay@calc.vet.uga.edu)
                            updated 10/16/94
                        

Introduction

id Software's DOOM is truly the Killer App of the MS-DOS world.
DOOM's popularity is so immense, it has been estimated that DOOM
is installed on more PCs than OS/2 and Windows NT combined, and
DOOM's creators commute to work in Ferarris. Interest in the game
has been so great that it has been hacked, reverse-engineered,
dissected, and enhanced more than any other game in PC history.
And now, as more and more people become hooked into the Internet,
DOOM is rapidly becoming the Killer App of the Internet, as well.

     Internet DOOM play is currently at the "clever hack" stage.
DOOM, as released by iD, supports only IPX network play and
serial play between two machines. As a result, the DOOM
documentation doesn't include any information about DOOMing
across the Internet. Of course, this also means that DOOMers
can't call id for help. The result of all this is many curious
people asking the same question: How do I play DOOM over the
Internet? Enter this document. In the pages that follow, we will
attempt to answer the most frequently asked questions about
Internet DOOM, including what you need, how to set it up, and how
to find new fragbait - er, I mean, opponents.

     DOOM across the Internet is made possible by a neat little
freeware program called iDOOM. iDOOM uses the UDP protocol (part
of the TCP/IP protocol suite) to send DOOM game information
between multiple machines on the Internet. It is based on the
WATTCP TCP/IP kernel written by Eric Engelke of the University of
Waterloo. By some strange coincidence, the authors of this
document are also the creators of iDOOM, and we have used the
program to play Internet DOOM sessions with opponents from as far
away as Estonia. In writing this FAQ, we hope that sharing some
of our experience will make it easier for you to get connected in
your own Internet DOOM sessions. NOTE: Throughout this document,
we will refer specifically to games of DOOM played over the
Internet via a DIRECT CONNECTION, i.e. no modems are involved
anywhere in the link. Note that IHHD, SLIP and PPP connections
all involve modems at some point. Although other methods of
connecting two DOOM machines together across the Internet exist,
this document will focus on direct net connections using the
iDOOM network driver program.

 Getting Prepared

     Q1: I want to play DOOM over the Internet using iDOOM. What
hardware do I need?

     To successfully play DOOM across the Internet, you will need
the following hardware:

     * A machine capable of playing DOOM (D'OHH!) 

     * A network interface card (NIC). And not just any old NIC,
     mind you - your NIC must be supported by a packet driver if
     you wish to use it to play Internet DOOM. Usually this means
     that your NIC must be an ethernet card, although iDOOM has
     been successfully played over token ring. This document
     assumes that your PC is already equipped with a suitable
     NIC, although it may currently be in use for some other
     non-TCP/IP function (such as a node on a Novell network).

     * A direct connection to the Internet. If there is a modem
     somewhere in the link between your PC and your opponent's
     PC, this FAQ is not for you. Although it is possible to play
     Internet DOOM over a modem link (either by dialing up to a
     UNIX machine and using IHHD or via SLIP/PPP), such
     connection methods are beyond the scope of this document.  
           
     Q2: OK, I've got all the hardware. What software do I need? 
               
     In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is
also required to round out your the package. Before you can play,
you'll need to pick up the following:

     * DOOM 1.2 or higher (1.7 is STRONGLY recommended, since
     this version seems to have solved some problems related to
     network games). DOOM versions 1.1 and below are incapable of
     using iDOOM.

     * A packet driver written specifically for your ethernet
     card. The Packet Driver is what lets iDOOM (and therefore
     DOOM) "talk" to your NIC.

     * iDOOM.EXE, the Internet driver for DOOM.  
     
     * The WATTCP Applications. These are not absolutely
     necessary, but can definitely be useful for debugging and
     testing your setup. 

     Q3: Hold on - I don't have some of this software! Where can
I get it?

     * To obtain iDOOM: Log on to ftp.vet.uga.edu via anonymous
     ftp. Change to directory /pub/doom. Download the file
     IDOOM11.ZIP. Version 1.1 is the latest version of iDOOM as
     of this writing. 

     * Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet
     drivers on a utilities diskette packaged with the card. If
     your card does not come with a packet driver, there is an
     excellent collection of freely available packet drivers
     called the Crynwr (nee Clarkson) Packet Driver collection.
     You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu.
     Change to the /pub/msdos/pktdrvr subdirectory and download
     PKTD11.ZIP and PKTD11C.ZIP. The files PKTD11A.ZIP and
     PKTD11B.ZIP contain source code and example programs for the
     packet drivers - you won't need these in order to play
     iDOOM.

     * To obtain the WATTCP applications, ftp to
     dorm.rutgers.edu, change to the /pub/msdos/wattcp/
     subdirectory, and download file APPS.ZIP.
               
     Q4: OK, I've got everything, now what do I do to set it up? 

     Setting your computer up for TCP/IP access is very
straightforward. As an illustration, I'll be taking you through
the steps necessary to set up a PC with an SMC ethernet card and
the IP address 128.192.23.5. You'll of course need to substitute
your own specific information in place of the examples given
here. All set? OK, let's get started.

     Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible. This
includes such things as memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386, QEMM,
etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI). DOOM doesn't need
the former, and the latter will probably conflict with the packet
driver. We recommend that you prepare a boot floppy with a
CONFIG.SYS containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT
containing only the line "prompt=$p$g".

     Step 1: Set up the packet driver. Determine your ethernet
card's IRQ setting, it's base I/O port setting, and it's memory
address setting (if any). You should be able to determine this by
looking at the card itself and consulting the user manual. You'll
need some if not all of this information, depending upon which
packet driver you use and/or type of hardware you have (for
example, some IBM computers with the MicroChannel bus can
determine the settings on the card automatically without you
having to supply them on the packet driver command line). Unzip
the appropriate driver from Crynwr Packet Driver collection
archive. In our example case, the packet driver is called
SMC_WD.COM. By looking at the jumpers on the card and consulting
the manual, I determined that the card has been set to IRQ 7,
Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory address is at
segment d800h. For this example, I have chosen to use interrupt
60h for the packet driver. Packet drivers typically operate on an
interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing
else in my sample system happens to be using the first available
interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that. Thus, to load my packet
driver, I use the command line


     SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800

where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is
the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
notation). Don't worry if you don't understand what all this
stuff means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet
driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a
Novell network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG,
usually located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT
subdirectories (along with all the other drivers needed by
Novell). 

     At the very minimum, the packet driver should give a sign on
message and report the ethernet address of your NIC when you load
it. Chances are that if your NIC has been functioning properly
for other tasks (e.g. as a node on a Novell network) then you'll
have no problems here. If not, or if there are any error or
warning messages, something is wrong. One possibility is that one
of the settings on your NIC is in conflict with those of another
expansion card in your system. No two cards can have the same
IRQ, I/O port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory
areas of two cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll need to
find and correct the problem before continuing.

     Step 2: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file. Your WATTCP.CFG file
contains important parameters used by the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel.
These values MUST be entered correctly if you wish to make a
connection with another DOOM PC. In preparation for this, you'll
need several bits of information. Contact the network
administrator for your site and find out the IP address for your
machine, the IP address for your gateway or router, the IP
address of at least one Domain Name Server local to your site,
and your netmask value. The three IP addresses will each consist
of four groups of digits separated by periods. In our example,
the machine's IP address is 128.192.23.5, the gateway is
128.192.23.1, the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the nameserver
address is 128.192.44.67. NOTE: it is important to use the
numeric IP addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you
have other Internet programs currently installed on your machine,
such as a Gopher client or the Trumpet newsreader, you can
probably find the information you need in the configuration files
used for those programs. If the application is based on the
Waterloo TCP package, it will have it's own WATTCP.CFG, in which
case you can simply copy it over to your DOOM directory. When you
have collected all this information, unzip the iDOOM distribution
archive (e.g. IDOOM11.ZIP) into your DOOM (or DOOM2) directory.
Use your favorite ASCII text editor to edit the file called
WATTCP.CFG. Edit or add the following lines in WATTCP.CFG:

my_ip=
gateway=
nameserver=
netmask=

     On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file looks like this: 
     
my_ip=128.192.23.5
gateway=128.192.23.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
nameserver=128.192.44.67

     Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

     If you know your machine's IP address, but you can't
determine the other values, you can often get away with some
educated guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet
usually has an IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our
example. Thus, if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting
your gateway's IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet
mask, a common value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. In some
cases, the gateway value can be something like xxx.yyy.1.1 with a
corresponding netmask value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work,
it can't hurt to try the other. Finally, if you don't know your
nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by without it for
the purposes of DOOM playing. Since you'll be specifying IP
addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a nameserver
lookup won't be necessary to resolve their addresses. 

     Step 3: Test your TCP/IP setup. Load your packet driver with
the appropriate interrupt, IRQ, I/O and memory addresses. Next,
unzip the TCPINFO and PING programs from the WATTCP apps archive
into your DOOM directory. At the DOS prompt, type:

          TCPINFO    

and press the <Enter> key. If your WATTCP.CFG values are set up
correctly, and if your packet driver and net connection are
functional, you'll see a couple of screens of information about
your system, including your ethernet address and the parameters
you specified in the WATTCP.CFG file. 

     If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING
program to attempt to establish contact with your subnet gateway.
At the DOS prompt, type

     PING <yourgateway's.numeric.ip.address>

and press the <Enter> key. After a brief delay, you should see a
message telling you that the host is responding, as well as the
round trip time for PING's test packets. If you see the "Timeout"
error message, then something is wrong with your setup; if your
PC is unable to reach your gateway, it will be unable to reach
the rest of the Internet as well, since all network packets which
are sent to nodes outside of your local area network must pass
through your gateway. For our sample system, we would type:

          ping 128.192.23.1

If your gateway PING was successful, try PINGing your Domain Name
Server (at the IP address you specified in WATTCP.CFG) as well as
some well-known site on the internet (e.g. infant2, which is at
IP address 129.79.234.115). These will test your machine's
ability to connect with other machines outside of your subnet as
well as those outside of your site. All of these PINGs should
result in a "host responding" message with a response time. If
any of these attempts fails, recheck your entries in WATTCP.CFG
and/or get some help from your network administrator. Examples
for our test system:

     ping 128.192.44.67

and

     ping 129.79.234.115


Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play! 
     First, go find up to three of your most patient frag
buddies. Since this is your first attempt at Internet DOOM, it's
best to try and find someone on your local network who's willing
to put in a little frag time with you. Connections on your local
net will be faster and less problematic, whereas if you attempt a
long distance connection your first time out, you'll have a hard
time discerning problems caused by distance from problems caused
by an incorrect configuration.

     Decide amongst yourselves which machine will be the "server"
(the remaining machines in the game will all be "clients"). The
server machine (and there can only be ONE server per game) acts
as the coordinator for that session. The player operating the
server is in some sense "the boss" - she can decide when to start
the game, which parameters (e.g. -altdeath, -nomonsters, -warp, -
skill, etc.) will be used, whether to kick a player out, and so
on.

     The server starts iDOOM as follows:

iDOOM -server [other game parameters]

     Once the server has started iDOOM running, the clients (all
remaining players) can then connect to the server. Each client
invokes iDOOM using the command line:

iDOOM -client <server_address>

     As an example, consider several computers which are part of
a local area network in a computer lab. In this lab there are
identical machines sitting side by side, with sequential IP
addresses, i.e. 128.192.23.4, 128.192.23.5, and 128.192.23.6.
After stepping through the basic configuration process outlined
above on all test machines, my frag buddies and I are ready to
begin. First, we all agree to play our favorite DEATHMATCH level,
DOOM I episode 1 map 5. We also agree to play in -altdeath mode,
with -skill 5 and -nomonsters. On my machine, which we decided
will be the server, I type:

iDOOM -server -warp 1 5 -altdeath -skill 5 -nomonsters

     The iDOOM screen comes up, and a message is displayed
informing me that iDOOM is entering server mode. This screen is
divided into several sections: the credits, the output window,
the status bar, and the input line. At the top of the screen is
the name of the program, its version number, and the copyright
notice. The large area beginning with the second screen line and
continuing to the 22nd screen line is the output window. Here is
where iDOOM will display all status messages as well as the chat
text entered by the other players. Below the output window is the
status bar, where the current game settings are displayed. Below
the status bar is the input line where all the text I type on my
keyboard will appear. Finally, the bottom line of the screen
lists significant contributors to iDOOM.

     Once my iDOOM server is up and running, all the other
players can connect to it. The other guys type:

iDOOM -client 128.192.23.5

     Each client's screen layout is identical to that of my
server. iDOOM displays a message confirming that it is entering
client mode and connecting to the server. As each client's
connection is established, the arrival of each player is
announced by the server. 

     During this phase of the game setup, all players who have
connected thus far can type messages to each other using iDOOM's
built-in chat facility. To send a message to the other players in
the game, I simply type my message on the keyboard. My keystrokes
appear in the input line at the bottom of the screen, and when I
press <ENTER>, the text will be echoed to the screens of all
players (along with an indication of who sent the message). The
identical procedure can be used to send messages from each of the
client machines. The server itself will also send messages.
Messages from the server will begin with three asterisks ("***"). 

     When a client connects to the iDOOM server, the client
receives a message containing the game parameters which will be
used during that session. These game settings will be displayed
on the status bar. The settings are abbreviated to ensure that
they will all fit within the available space. These game settings
may be changed interactively at the server console.

     My friend sees that I have selected E1M5 as the default
episode and map for our game. He reminds me that we've been
playing that one a lot lately, and suggests we change to E2M2
since we haven't played that one in a while. I agree, and issue
the commands /episode 2 and /map 2 to change the level. Our
status lines are immediately updated to reflect these changes.

     Once I have determined (via the chat facility) that everyone
is ready to begin the game, I press the F10 key. The iDOOM server
signals the clients that the game is beginning, the chat facility
is shut down, and iDOOM sets up the connections which will be
used for the actual game. Once these network links are
established between all the machines, the message "Prepare to
meet your DOOM!" is displayed, followed by the usual DOOM startup
information. Shortly thereafter, the screen melts away and there
we are, in E1M5, pistols at the ready! 

     Give your buddies a good thrashing - you've earned it! Now,
after you've gotten DOOM working on your own subnet, you're ready
for the final step. Find a partner who is also capable of playing
Internet DOOM. Watch the posts in alt.games.doom, or tune into
the #doom, #tcpdoom or #iDOOM channels on irc. You and he will
negotiate game parameters, such as which map to play, which skill
level, and so on. You'll also decide on who will be the server
and who will be the clients (experienced DEATHMATCHers will often
try very hard to avoid being the server, since that player's
uniform is colored day-glo green and is easier to spot in a
DEATHMATCH). Now simply add the parameters you've agreed on to
the iDOOM server command line you used before. A typical          
command line will look something like

          iDOOM -server -skill 5 -nomonsters -deathmatch 

Oh Oh - It's Not Working!

          OK, so you've done everything, just like I've shown
you, but you're still having problems. The following are some
suggestions to try in case of trouble.

     Q: When I try to connect to the iDOOM server it returns to
DOS saying "Server is not responding" or "Remote reset
connection."

     A: This means that the player on the server machine hasn't
yet  started the iDOOM server. The server must be started before
the clients try to connect to it. Try again in a few seconds.


     Q: I keep seeing an "ICMP: port unreachable" message on my
screen.

     A: This message is generated by the other machine when the
port being requested by the sender is unavailable on the          
destination machine. I've seen this happen in some cases when I
started iDOOM before the other player did. Once the other iDOOM
was running, the ICMP: messages went away, and the game linked up
normally. If you see this message, you might also want to try
using a different port (see the iDOOM documentation on the -port
command line parameter). 

     Q: The music starts up fine, but all I see is a BSOD (Black
Screen of Death).
     Q: My machine displays "sending network start info" or
"listening for network start info" and then locks up. 

     A: This problem can have several causes. Perhaps the server
specified a DOOM II game, but one of the players didn't have DOOM
II. Perhaps one of the other players' machines is slower than the
others, or has a fragmented disk and takes a longer time to load
DOOM at startup. Or perhaps some packets were lost - iDOOM uses
UDP (user Datagram Protocol) packets to exchange game information
between all machines in the game. UDP packets are not guaranteed
to reach their destination, and there is no mechanism for the
sender to even be informed that what it sent never made to the
destination machine. iDOOM is designed to compensate for these
lost packets to the extent possible, and occasionally this
detection and correction takes a few extra seconds. You should
always wait for at least 30 - 45 seconds for the other DOOM
engines to sync up before you abort the setup. 

                        Frag Servers/Frag Trackers

     Frag Servers are a recent development. They facilitate iDOOM
connections between multiple players quickly and easily and with
a minimum of command line typing. Current versions of the Frag
Servers are very similar to the server built into iDOOM. NOTE: An
iDOOM client can NOT connect to a Frag Server. Frag Servers have
their own client program which then loads iDOOM as the network
driver. 

     As of this writing, the latest version of the frag
client/server package is TCPSRV12.ZIP, available from one of the
infant2 mirrors in the /pub/doom/multi_doom/net directory. A
couple of the more popular fragservers can be found at
ararat.cs.ucdavis.edu and patriot.et.buy.edu. Both of these
support 2, 3 and 4 player games on ports 1666, 1667, and 1668
respectively.

     Future versions of the Frag Servers (which will be known as
Frag Trackers) will serve as online meeting places where DOOM
players can log on, see a list of games which are awaiting
players, and either join an existing game or register a new game.
Waiting players will be able to send chat messages to each other,
negotiate and set game parameters, check connection quality, etc.
Although this exciting capability does not exist in the current
Frag Servers, it will be available sometime in the near future,
and will revolutionize the way Internet DOOM is played.

[8-6]: How can I setup DOOM to be played on a multi-player BBS?
===============================================================
     Applied Personal Computing, Inc. has recently developed a platform that
allows almost any multiline BBS to host 2-4 player network DOOM games.

     The APCi MultiPlayer Game Server allows gamers to create a simulated
IPX network just by dialing the host BBS at high speed.  APCi MultiPlayer
Game Client software makes use of the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server very
intuitive for even the newest user of online services.  Best of all,
all APCi MultiPlayer Game Client software is FREEWARE and includes any
and all information desired about the supported game.

     For more information regarding the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server, or to
witness the APCi MPGS in action, call the APCi BBS at (618) 632-7664.  You
may also contact APCi at 1-800-535-APCi.  More information can also be
requested from Kevin Sawyer (sawyerk@delphi.com).

(8-7): Where can I find multi-player partners?
==============================================
        A good place to find people to play with is on Usenet is the
"alt.games.doom" newsgroup or on IRC on the #DOOM channel.
