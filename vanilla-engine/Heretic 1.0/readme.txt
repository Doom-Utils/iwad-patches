HERETIC Version 1.0 release notes:
------------------------------------------------------------
id Software respectfully requests that you do not modify the
levels for the shareware version of Heretic.  We feel that the
distribution of new levels that work with the shareware version
of Heretic will lessen a potential user's incentive to purchase the
registered version.

If you would like to work with modified levels of Heretic, we
encourage you to purchase the registered version of the game. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Additional support

Auxiliary programs
------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of auxiliary programs that come with Heretic. These
are DM.EXE, the DeathManager you use as a front-end for network and
modem play; DWANGO.EXE, the client software for the NEW multiplayer
gaming environment of the future; IPXSETUP.EXE, the IPX Network Device 
Driver that enables you to play Heretic over an office network that uses 
the IPX protocol and SERSETUP.EXE, the Serial Device Driver that enables 
you to play Heretic over the modem or serial cable.

The documentation for the DM.EXE program is named DM.TXT, the documentation
for the DWANGO.EXE program is named DWANGO.TXT. The documentation for the
IPXSETUP.EXE and SERSETUP.EXE programs follow.

------------------------------------------------------------
Heretic ADDENDUM
------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Heretic. Before playing, you might want to read this
addendum which contains information for playing in Multiplayer mode, 
as well as technical support and troubleshooting instructions. To 
avoid compatibility errors, please make sure that your machine and 
network conform to the system requirements listed below.

-------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Heretic(TM) requires an IBM compatible 486 or better with 4 megs of 
RAM, a VGA graphics card, and a hard disk drive. A 486/66 or 
better, a Sound Blaster Pro(TM) or 100% compatible sound card 
is recommended. A network that uses the IPX protocol is 
required for network gameplay. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER MODE
-------------------------------------------------------------
GETTING STARTED
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install Heretic as described in the manual. 

2. Launch Heretic from the SETUP program, by going to the 
directory in which you installed Heretic, type SETUP, and press 
the ENTER key. (If you are installing Heretic for the first 
time the SETUP program will be automatically launched.) 
Unlike playing Heretic in single player mode, Heretic in 
multiplayer mode must be run either from the DM program, the SETUP 
program or by using the command line parameters mentioned later in 
this addendum. 

3. The SETUP program not only allows you to configure Heretic 
to your system but lets you tell Heretic information that is 
necessary for the multiplayer game, (i.e. number of players, 
skill level, mode, etc.), although the DM program is the preferred 
method of starting a network game.

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: A maximum of four people can play 
multiplayer Heretic on a network. 

COMPATIBLE NETWORKS: To play multiplayer, you must have a 
network that uses the IPX protocol. Check your network 
manuals for information regarding your protocol. Novell 
networks use the IPX protocol. 

MULTIPLE GAMES ON THE NET: To play a multiplayer game while 
another group is also playing the multiplayer game, you'll 
need to change your network port address from the SETUP 
application. The port address tells your server where to 
send information that is sent over the network. Network 
addresses range from 1-64000. You should refer to the person 
in charge of your network for possible port addresses.

-------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the rules for playing Heretic change for the 
multiplayer game. Read the following information carefully 
before you begin to play Heretic in multiplayer mode.

MENUS: When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the 
game KEEPS RUNNING so that other players can continue with 
the action. So it is best to find a safe place before 
adjusting screen sizes or sounds.

UNPAUSE: A player may Pause the game by pressing the PAUSE 
key, but any other player can Unpause the game by pressing 
the PAUSE key again. Make sure it's OK with your buddies 
before taking a breather.

SAVE: When you do a savegame during a network game, it saves 
on every player's system in the savegame slot you select, 
writing over whatever was there. Before saving the game, 
players should agree on a safe slot to save in.

LOAD: You cannot load a saved game while playing a 
multiplayer game. To load a game everyone must quit from the 
current game and restart the game from the saved game. To 
start a game from a saved game, you can either select it 
from the SETUP program or identify it as a command line 
parameter.

DEATH: If you die and restart in the level, previously 
destroyed monsters DON'T reappear. Even though you've died, 
other players have survived. We didn't want to undo all of 
their fine destruction by reviving every monster in the area. 
However, this also means the level will eventually run dry of 
monsters. You'll have to decide when the level is played out.

UNIFORM COLORS: In net games, each player's uniform is a 
different color. The color of your character is the color 
of the life gem on the status bar's life chain. The colors are 
BLUE, YELLOW, GREEN, and RED. 

CHAT MODE: In a multiplayer game you can communicate with 
other players in the Chat mode. To enter into Chat mode and 
broadcast a message to all the players, press the letter t. 
A cursor will appear where your messaging is normally 
placed. To broadcast to a specific player, instead of 
pressing t you'll need to press the first letter of the 
player's color. (B)lue, (Y)ellow, (G)reen, and (R)ed. For 
example, to send a message to the blue character, you would 
press the letter b.

CHAT MACROS: In a multiplayer game, you can send your own
pre-defined macros (defined in the SETUP program) by initiating
Chat mode (as stated above), then holding ALT and pressing the
number key that corresponds to the macro you wish to send. For
example, if macro #2 is "Eat it and die!", initiate Chat mode
by pressing 'T', then hold down ALT and press 2.

EXITING A LEVEL: When one player exits a level, all players 
instantly exit with him, regardless of their position or 
their status.

-------------------------------------------------------------
COOPERATIVE OR DEATHMATCH MODE
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to play multiplayer--DeathMatch and 
Cooperative. In Cooperative mode the players work together. 
In DeathMatch mode your mission is to kill everything that 
moves, including your buddies. You can choose which mode you 
wish to play from the DM or SETUP applications. The differences 
between Cooperative and DeathMatch mode are as follows:

WHERE YOU START: In Cooperative mode each player begins in 
the same area. In DeathMatch mode the players begin in 
completely different areas--if you want to see your buddy 
you'll need to hunt him down. Plus, each time you die, 
you'll restart in one of several random locations.

KEYS: Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, 
in DeathMatch mode the players start each location with the 
keys necessary for opening any locked door in that area.

STATUS BAR: In DeathMatch mode the LIFE section on the 
status bar is replaced with KILLS. The KILLS section 
displays the number of times you've killed your opponents.

AUTOMAP: In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way 
it does in single-player mode. Each player is represented by 
a different color arrow. In DeathMatch mode you won't 
receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on the map. 
Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around 
the corner, and you won't know until you face them.

SPY MODE: If you're playing in Cooperative mode, press F12 
to toggle through the other players' viewpoint(s). Press any 
other key to return to your view. You still retain your own 
status bar at the bottom, and if your view reddens from pain 
it is YOU, not your partner, who has been hit.

INTERMISSION SCREENS: In both Cooperative and DeathMatch 
mode the intermission screen tallies your achievement. In 
Cooperative mode the intermission screen lists the 
achievements for all players in the game. In DeathMatch mode 
the intermission provides a death count on everyone, letting 
you know who killed whom.

-------------------------------------------------------------
DEATHMATCH MODE GAMEPLAY NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------
The rules for completing or winning a DeathMatch game have 
intentionally been left general. Any player can exit an area 
and force all of the players to move to the next area. Also, 
there is no limit on how many kills are required to declare 
a player the winner. We decided to leave this up to you. You 
know what you like best! 

Note: Before you play Heretic in DeathMatch mode you should be 
familiar with the layout of every area in Heretic. As you know, 
in DeathMatch mode your startup location is random and often 
in an area that is very hostile. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
MULTIPLAYER DEMO RECORDING
-------------------------------------------------------------
You can record your tournaments for posterity!  To record multi-
player demos, add the line "-record demoz" to the command-line.
Make sure the other player is recording also, or it won't work.
If you need more time, add the "-maxdemo <K>" option to increase
demo buffer space.  Make sure both of you specify the same amount.
Heretic defaults to 128K of demo buffer space, to specify 1meg you
would type "-maxdemo 1024" on the command-line.

IF HERETIC BOMBS TO DOS WITH A "Z_MALLOC" ERROR, YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MEMORY FOR THE MAXDEMO AMOUNT SPECIFIED!

When you wish to stop recording, press the Q or F10 keys and both
players will exit to DOS.  To play the demo back, merely type,
"heretic -playdemo demoz" and the demo will play back.  To see the
other player, press the F12 key.  Press F12 to toggle between all
players in the demo.  The TAB key will display the automap.

You can set the name of the demo file to anything you want. "demoz"
was just an example name.

-------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING HERETIC FROM THE COMMAND LINE 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Much of the information you give to Heretic through the DM and 
SETUP program can be provided by passing program parameters to 
the appropriate device driver on the command line. 

NETWORK PLAY
------------
When you want to run a network game, you use IPXSETUP.EXE which
is the device driver for Heretic's network mode. The parameters 
are as follows:

-NODES starts Heretic as a network game and sets the number of 
players who are going to play. If you don't specify the number
of nodes, the default is 2.
-nodes <# of players>

-PORT sets the port from which to play Heretic multiplayer on 
the network. By setting a different port, more than one 
group of players can play Heretic on a single network. 
-port <# of the port>

MODEM PLAY
----------
When you want to play a modem or null-modem game, you need to
run SERSETUP.EXE which is the device driver for Heretic's serial
communications mode.  The parameters are as follows:

-DIAL tells the program which number to dial, if you're going
to do the calling.
-dial <phone number>

-ANSWER puts your modem into Answer mode so someone can call
you and play Heretic.
-answer

-COM1, -COM2, -COM3, -COM4 specifies which COM port your modem
or serial cable is connected to. Very important!
-com1

-8250 tells SERSETUP to set the UART to 8250.  Just in case your
16550 UART is acting up at the higher speed.
-8250

-IRQ sets the IRQ for the COM port.
-irq <irq number>

-PORT sets the COM I/O port that SERSETUP uses to communicate
with your modem.  To use hexadecimal, such as the number 0x3f8, you
would type "-port 0x3f8".
-port <port number>

-<#> sets the baud rate of your COM port, overriding the value in
the MODEM.CFG if you're running a modem game.  Legal values are
9600, 14400, 38400, 57600.
Example: -14400

Note that to run a null-modem game, you must have a null-modem
cable plugged into a serial port on both computers and each
computer runs SERSETUP.EXE with a -COM# parameter as well as
any General Parameters.  Do not use the -ANSWER or -DIAL
parameters, or SERSETUP will think you're using a modem. To get
a null-modem cable, go to CompUSA or Radio Shack and say,"I need
a null-modem cable to run a Heretic multiplayer game."

VERY IMPORTANT!
You will need to run the SETUP program and select Choose Modem
from the Network/Modem/Serial menu so you can set your modem
init string correctly.  Merely select the modem and press Enter
and SETUP will create a new MODEM.CFG file that corresponds to
your modem (the MODEM.CFG file is used by SERSETUP for initing
the modem.)

If your modem is not in the list, you will most likely need to
edit the MODEM.CFG file in the Heretic directory.  The first line
of the file is an initialization string that:
    * Turns off error-correction
    * Turns off data-compression
The MODEM.CFG file has a Hayes-standard init string like this:
AT Z S=46 &Q0 &D0
You just add your own commands after the "AT Z " if your modem
doesn't work with these settings -- dig up your modem manual for
the correct settings.

The second line is a hangup string used when you quit Heretic.

The third line is the baud rate at which you want your COM port set.
The legal settings are: 9600, 14400, 38400, 57600.

If the modem connection isn't working when you call your friend,
have him call you instead.  Try setting the modem to GENERIC (in the
SETUP.EXE program) if your modems don't connect.

If you STILL can't get the modems to connect, both of you should
run your favorite COMM programs and connect with 9600, no error
correction and no data compression.  Then quit the COMM program
and keep the connection going.  Then just run SERSETUP with a -COM#
parameter (as if you were running a null-modem game) since you're
already connected.

If you had trouble connecting, but figured out some settings that
work, please fax them to us at (214) 686-9288 so we can expand our
modem init string database and perhaps have the SETUP program ask
you for your modem type in a future version of Heretic.

GENERAL PARAMETERS
------------------
These parameters can be passed straight to Heretic, or passed
to IPXSETUP or SERSETUP, which then pass them to Heretic.

-LOADGAME allows you to start Heretic from a specified save 
game. Instead of using the saved game name, simply enter the 
number that corresponds to the slot you saved the game to on 
the SAVE GAME screen (0-5).
-loadgame <# of the game>

-DEATHMATCH starts Heretic as a DeathMatch game. If you don't 
enter DEATHMATCH as a command line parameter, Heretic will 
default to the Cooperative mode. All items picked up will
appear 30 seconds later and the Shadowsphere and Invulnerability
Ring will not come back.
-deathmatch

-SKILL sets the skill level (1-5) you wish to play.   Only useful 
with -warp -- see below.
-skill <# of skill level>

-EPISODE sets the episode (1-3) you wish to play. The default 
episode is Episode One, City of the Damned.
-episode <# of the episode>

-CONFIG allows you to use your configuration file from any 
directory you choose. This is primarily for diskless workstations 
that don't have a C: drive to save config information to. You 
need to rename the heretic.cfg file created by the SETUP program 
to a directory and name of your choosing to avoid conflicts.
-config <pathname>  ex. -config f:\heretic\data\myconfig.cfg

-NOMONSTERS allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running
around!  This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters
just get in the way.  Only useful with -warp -- see below.
-nomonsters

-RECORD tells Heretic to record the game you are starting.
Demo files will be saved as <filename>.lmp.
-record <filename>

-RESPAWN tells Heretic that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, you
want all the monsters to respawn around 8 seconds after you kill
them.  The NIGHTMARE skill level already does this. Note that 
using -respawn and -nomonsters at the same time is a dumb thing 
to do.  Only useful with -warp -- see below.
-respawn

@<filename> will allow you to specify a Response file that Heretic
will read additional command-line parameters from.  For example,
typing 'Heretic @MYPARMS' will tell Heretic to look in the MYPARMS file
for additional command-line parameters.  The file format is simply
one parameter per line with a carriage return to terminate the line.
Each parameter is typed exactly as you would type it on the DOS
command-line.

-TIMER <# of minutes> will make Heretic exit the current level after
a specified amount of minutes, going to the intermission screen.
This option is only useful in DeathMatch mode.
-timer xxx

An example line for entering the above information would be: 
Heretic -loadgame 3 -deathmatch -skill 4 -timer 10

IMPORTANT:  Only the following command-line parameters are available
while using the -WARP parameter:
-skill, -respawn.

-------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING ADDENDUM
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you require technical assistance to run Heretic, call id 
Software's technical support line at (303) 339-7111 or 
e-mail help@idsoftware.com.
 
If possible, please be near your computer when calling id 
Software's technical support. Please have information 
regarding your system setup and configuration available. 

Before changing your system or software setup we recommend 
that you review your system manuals to ensure that your 
modifications will not endanger any existing information or 
hardware on you system or network. Modifying your system or 
your software setup can be dangerous, and we cannot help you 
with any resulting problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------
When Heretic runs, I get an "Insufficient Memory" error or Heretic 
just doesn't run.

You don't have enough free RAM to run Heretic.  This usually
happens with 4Mb RAM machines -- you need about 3Mb of free
RAM to run Heretic. If you have DOS 6 or later, boot your system 
and hold the left-shift key as the "Starting MS-DOS..." 
message appears. This will bare-boot your system and you must 
change to the Heretic directory and run Heretic. Your best bet is 
to make a CONFIG.SYS menu for a custom Heretic boot -- see 
page 97 in your MS-DOS 6 User's Manual. 
If you have DOS 5.0 or earlier, you must create a bare boot disk.        

Note: Do not use memory managers like EMM386, QEMM, etc.
Do not use disk caching programs like SMARTDRV, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I get a "WRITE ERROR" while Heretic is decompressing.

You are using a disk compression program such as STACKER or 
DOUBLESPACE. These utilities try to make an "educated" <ahem> 
guess as to how much disk space you have left.  Obviously, 
they're wrong.  Delete some big games that are chewing up 
hard drive space, like any Wolf-alikes or DOOM-alikes. :D

-------------------------------------------------------------
The Windows SETUP program runs after installation.

Heretic did not install to your hard drive, probably due to 
insufficient disk space.  See above answer for a solution.

-------------------------------------------------------------
My GUS doesn't work.

The default IRQ for a GUS is 11. Heretic doesn't handle IRQ's 
above 7.  Change this with your GUS setup program.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I can't get digital sound from my Sound Blaster compatible 
sound card.

You are experiencing a DMA conflict. You may have a CD-ROM 
or hard drive on the same DMA channel that you specified in 
Heretic's SETUP program. Change the DMA channel of the sound 
card or offending device.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Heretic locks up before I see the title screen or at the title
screen.

You need to turn "Hidden Refresh" off in your CMOS Advanced 
Chipset settings. If you're using RAMBIOS.SYS, you must 
remove it from your CONFIG.SYS. Make sure you also turn off 
any Hardware Video Shadowing (also found in CMOS settings.)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Heretic runs really slow, locks or "pauses" on a fast system.

Some systems have a option in the CMOS setup for switching
the speed of the PC from the keyboard. This is the 
"Turbo Switch" or "Turbo Switching" option. Disable this 
setting and your problem should be fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I hear static when listening to Heretic with my Sound Blaster 
(or compatible) card.

Run SBP-MIX (in your SBPRO directory) and turn down Line and 
Mic volumes to 0.

-------------------------------------------------------------
I still hear static, or my sound effects are breaking up.

Disconnect any parallel port devices. (Sound cards,
to work with Heretic, must use IRQ5 or IRQ7, which are
used by LPT2 and LPT1 -- where printers are connected.)

-------------------------------------------------------------
I can't get sound on my ATI Stereo FX card.

Contact ATI for a BIOS upgrade.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Heretic is too dark to see anything.

On some monitors, Heretic may be too dark to play. Press F-11 
to improve the view.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why can't I get music or sound effects?

If you're not hearing sound effects and/or music, Heretic may 
have incorrect information regarding your sound card. Run 
the SETUP program to check if Heretic has the correct 
information on your sound card. 

Note: Heretic only supports IRQ numbers which or 7 or below. 
Be sure you set your sound card to an IRQ number which
is 7 or below. Refer to your sound card manual for details
on setting your IRQ number. 

Note: This is particularly important for Gravis Ultra Sound 
users because the standard default for the GUS card is 11.

--------------------------------------------------------------
How can I run Heretic under OS/2?

The ideal Heretic-OS/2 system is a 486/66 with at least 8MB of 
RAM. In order to get Heretic up and running, first copy a 
program object to the desktop from the templates folder. For 
details on this procedure, please refer to your OS/2 Manual. 
Once you have the program path and optional command line 
arguments set up for the program object, you will need to 
edit the DOS session settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------
During startup, the Heretic startup stops at "looking for node..."

This occurs when you enter a number of players greater than 
the amount of players actually entering the game. For 
example, if you only have three players playing, but you 
tell Heretic to expect four players, it will wait until the 
fourth player starts the game. Press ESC to exit and restart 
the game with the correct number of players. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
I'm receiving the error, "IPX NETWORK NOT DETECTED."

Currently, Heretic only supports a network that uses the IPX 
protocol. If you receive this message, check your network 
manual to ensure your network uses the IPX protocol. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
I've received the message, "CONSISTENCY FAILURE" while 
running Heretic.

For Heretic to run properly as a multiplayer game, all of the 
machines that are running Heretic must maintain a nearly 
identical status of the game during network play. If you 
receive this message, something has occurred which caused 
the multiplayer game on one computer to be different from 
the multiplayer games running on the other systems. If this 
occurs, all of the players must quit from Heretic and restart 
the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why can't I get Heretic to run as a multiplayer game?

If someone else is running Heretic in multiplayer you may 
receive a network port conflict. From the SETUP program, 
change Heretic to run under a different port. Consult with the 
person in charge of your network to receive a valid port 
address. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why isn't the animation smooth?

If the animation isn't running smoothly on your system you 
should try reducing the window size. Refer to your Heretic manual 
for instructions on this options.  Or get a faster computer! :D

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why doesn't my mouse work with Heretic?

If you renamed or commented-out information in your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT you may have removed the command which loads 
your mouse driver. Loading your mouse driver into DOS can be 
as simple as typing MOUSE and pressing ENTER at the command 
prompt. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why can't I find a plasma rifle, BFG 9000, Berserk power-up, 
or invulnerability power-up?

Because you're playing Heretic, not DOOM or DOOM II. Please ask
us questions that make darn good sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Why can't I find the Hellstaff or Phoenix Rod or any of the
other really cool power-ups I've heard about?

Because you haven't bought the registered version of Heretic yet.
These awesome components of Heretic are available ONLY in the
registered version.  Call 1-800-IDGAMES for a remedy.
