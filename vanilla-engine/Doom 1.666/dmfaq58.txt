CHAPTER [1]: Introduction
-------------------------

*1-1*: A word from Hank Leukart
===============================
        Because I have ESP, I know that right now, you're thinking:

        "What in the world is he doing?  He's releasing yet ANOTHER FAQ?
Is this guy satanic or what?"

        id decided that in the last few weeks that they should keep
releasing versions of DOOM on the Internet until they had a version with no
bugs. :)  And, hopefully, with v1.666, they will have finally done it.  So,
here is the "Official" DOOM FAQ, v5.8.  Who was it who sent me E-mail asking
if I was a masochist? <grin>

        Because I have ESP, I know that right now, you're thinking:

        "Wait a minute!  I just downloaded DOOM v1.666.  Why did I get this
incredible FAQ with it?"

        id Software was kind enough to allow me to package the FAQ with
DOOM v1.61bt and with DOOM v1.666.  I think this will be great for all DOOM
players, as many of their questions can be answered immediately.  This should
also cut down on questions to id's technical support.

        Because I have ESP, I know that right now, you're thinking:

        "Okay, now what is he going to talk about?  After all, it has only
been a few weeks since the last FAQ!  What new, cool add-on utilities could
he plug?

        I do admit that in the last few weeks, I haven't seen any major
upgrades on any of the DOOM editors or other popular utilities.  I have
seen, however, a new utility that has probably caught on the fastest of any
of the add-ons.  Matt Fell recently released a small file outlining the
DOOM.EXE.  This file gave way to DEHACKED by Greg Lewis
(gregory.lewis@umich.edu).  And what a COOL utility!  Some of the patches
made for DEHACKED allow monster "morphing," a shotgun that fires as fast
as a chain gun, and a flame thrower to replace the plasma gun.  Other
special-effects include flying enemies and enemies that look like trees.  I
recommend downloading this utility along with some of the patches.  See
Chapters [13-2] and [14-6] for more information.

        Because I have ESP, I know that right now, you're thinking:

        "Let me see.  If I can scramble my brain waves, maybe he won't be
able to read my mind anymore."

        Okay, you figured me out.  I don't actually have ESP after all.
Anyway, watch out for mind readers, memorize the FAQ, and above all, "keep
on DOOMing!"

[1-2]: About the "Official" DOOM FAQ
====================================
        Welcome to the post-release v5.8 of the "Official" DOOM FAQ.  What
does that mean?  Post-release is after the game is released, version 5.8 is a
minor revision written after 5.7, "Official" means absolutely nothing,
DOOM is the name of the game, and FAQs are [F]requently [A]sked [Q]uestions.
        Here's how revision classification works.  If a new version of
the FAQ only has a small amount of information changed or added, the version
number is increased by 0.1.  This is called a "minor revision."  If a new
version of the FAQ has a substantial amount of new information changed or
added, the version number is increased by 0.5.  This is called a "standard
revision." If a new version of the FAQ has a huge amount of added or changed
information, major parts of the FAQ are rearranged, or major parts of the FAQ
are rewritten, then the version number is increased by 1.0.  This is called a
"major revision."
        You may be wondering why chapter numbers are enclosed in either
[]'s, ()'s, or **'s.  The definition of these is as follows:

        []: Chapters enclosed in brackets mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated in this or the
            previous FAQ.
        (): Chapters enclosed in parenthesis mean that the information
            contained in the chapter has not been updated since the previous
            FAQ.
        **: Chapters enclosed in asterisks means that the information
            contained in the chapter is new or has been updated for the
            current version of the FAQ you are reading.

*1-6*: Acknowledgments
======================
          I'd like to thank id Software for creating such a GREAT
game!  It definitely exceeds expectations.  I'd also like to thank them
for helping me out, and getting involved with on-line users.  I'd like to
thank the following on-line users for the following reasons:

ID SOFTWARE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER:

John Romero (help@idsoftware.com)

        What a guy!  He's been putting up with my infinite
cross-examinations for six months now, and he still hasn't killed me!  He
also read through the ENTIRE FAQ to give me a list of corrections for this
release.  A BIG thanks, John!  (oh yeah, he also programmed that game --
what was it called?! :))

David Taylor (help@idsoftware.com)

        Three cheers for David Taylor!  His once-in-a-while "idNews" Usenet
postings always seem to cut down the amount of E-mail I get for a few
hours.  He also, has put up with me, and answered numerous questions.

Jay Wilbur (help@idsoftware.com)

        You've got to admire this guy.  He puts his life and his family's
life on the line everytime he posts a release date (or "within two weeks")
on Usenet.  He's a great CEO, a great net representative, and handled the
small island travel arrangements at a time in which we thought we might be
pummeled. :)

        And to everyone else at id Software, thanks for a great game!

[1-7]: Accurate Information
===========================
        An attempt has been made to make the information in this FAQ as
accurate as possible.  Unfortunately, due to the fact that the game
was recently released, and updates, add-ons, and new information are being
worked on each second, it's hard to keep up.  I had to stop myself from
adding to the FAQ, because if I didn't it would have never been released!
The original press release dated from January 1993 listed a few things that
didn't go in the final game.  Some of those things were impossible to do
after rewriting the 3-D engine 4 times over (for speed and size); other
things just made no sense with the rest of the design.  Trust id Software.
They know what they are doing.  DOOM is one great game!

=====================================
=SECTION ONE= PRELIMINARY INFORMATION
=====================================

--------------------------
CHAPTER [2]: What is DOOM?
--------------------------

        DOOM is a three dimensional, virtual reality type action game
created by id Software.  In some ways, it is similar to Wolfenstein 3-D
(id Software, Apogee).
        In DOOM, you're a space marine, one of Earth's toughest, hardened in
combat and trained for action.  Three years ago you assaulted a superior
officer for ordering his soldiers to fire upon civilians.  He and his body
cast were shipped to Pearl Harbor, while you were transferred to Mars, home
of the Union Aerospace Corporation.
        The UAC is a multi-planetary conglomerate with radioactive waste
facilities on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.  With no action for
fifty million miles, your day consisted of suckin' dust and watchin'
restricted flicks in the rec room.
        For the last four years the military, UAC's biggest supplier, has
used the remote facilities on Phobos and Deimos to conduct various
secret projects, including research on inter-dimensional space travel.
So far they have been able to open gateways between Phobos and Deimos,
throwing a few gadgets into one and watching them come out the other.
Recently however, the gateways have grown dangerously unstable.
Military "volunteers" entering them have either disappeared or been
stricken with a strange form of insanity--babbling vulgarities,
bludgeoning anything that breathes, and finally suffering an untimely
death of full-body explosion.  Matching heads with torsos to send home
to the folks became a full-time job.  Latest military reports state
that the research is suffering a small setback, but everything is
under control.
        A few hours ago, Mars received a garbled message from Phobos.  "We
require immediate military support.  Something fraggin' evil is coming
out of the gateways!  Computer systems have gone berserk!" The rest
was incoherent.  Soon afterwards, Deimos simply vanished from the sky.
Since then, attempts to establish contact with either moon have been
unsuccessful.
        You and your buddies, the only combat troop for fifty million miles
were sent up pronto to Phobos.  You were ordered to secure the perimeter of
the base while the rest of the team went inside.  For several hours, your
radio picked up the sounds of combat: guns firing, men yelling orders,
screams, bones cracking, then finally silence.  Seems your buddies are dead.
        Things aren't looking too good.  You'll never navigate off the
planet on your own.  Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by
the assault team leaving you only with a pistol.  If only you could get your
hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on
your way out.  Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in
the forehead.  Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod.  Hopefully you
can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station.  As you
walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls
echoing throughout the distant corridors.  They know you're here.  There's no
turning back now.

------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [3]: What makes DOOM different from Wolfenstein 3-D?
------------------------------------------------------------

[3-1]: Texture-Mapped Environment
=================================
        DOOM offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC.
Texture-mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and scanned
textures on the walls, floors, and ceilings of an environment, makes the
world much more real, thus bringing the player more into the game experience.
Others have attempted this, but DOOM's texture mapping is fast, accurate,
and seamless.  Texture-mapping the floors and ceilings is a big improvement
over Wolfenstein 3-D.  With their new advanced graphic development
techniques, allowing game art to be generated much faster, id brings
new meaning to "state-of-the-art".

[3-2]: Non-Orthogonal Walls
===========================
        In other games (such as Wolfenstein 3-D), walls were always joined
at ninety degrees to each other, and were always eight feet thick.  DOOM's
walls are at many angles, and of any thickness.  Walls have see-through
areas, like windows.  This allows more natural construction of levels.  If
you can draw it on paper, you can see it in the game.

[3-3]: Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing
=======================================
        Another touch adding realism is light diminishing.  With distance,
your surroundings become enshrouded in darkness.  This makes areas seem huge
and intensifies the experience.  This also creates some amazing effects;
sometimes the lights go out, and you'll have to look for a light switch or
light amplification visors.  Light sourcing allows lamps and lights to
illuminate hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe lights to
briefly reveal things near them.  These features make the game
frighteningly real.

[3-4]: Variable Height Floors and Ceilings
==========================================
        Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs, poles,
altars, plus low hallways and high caves-allowing a great variety for rooms
and halls.
        In DOOM, monsters can be shot on levels that are higher or lower than
you are.  All you have to do is aim horizontally, and DOOM will do the rest!

[3-5]: Environment Animation and Morphing
=========================================
        In DOOM, the world reacts to you.  Many surfaces animate.
A glowing wall-plate may change in appearance when you touch it. Radioactive
ooze could seethe and bubble.
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about environment animation
and morphing.  id Software removed information terminals, access stations,
and wall weapon damaging.  DOOM does include "crushing ceilings," however.

[3-6]: Palette Translation
==========================
        In earlier versions of the FAQ, I talked about many different
types of palette translation.  Most of the palette translation has been
removed from DOOM.  The only palette translations that are currently
implemented in DOOM are for multi-player mode (other players are in
different colors), invincibility mode and a few other special effects.

[3-7]: Multiple Players
=======================
        Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players
can play by modem or serial link.  DOOM v1.2 supports modem play.
You can see the other player in the environment, communicate with him or her,
and in certain situations you can switch to their view.  This feature, added
to the 3-D realism, makes DOOM a very powerful cooperative game and its
release a landmark event in the software industry.  This is the first game to
really exploit the power of LANs and modems to their full potential.  In
1994, id Software fully expects to be the number one cause of decreased
productivity in businesses around the world.  See Chapter [8] for more
information on multi-playing.

[3-8]: Smooth, Seamless Gameplay
================================
        The environment in DOOM is frightening, but the player can be at
ease when playing.  Much effort has been spent on the development end to
provide the smoothest control on the user end.  And the frame rate (the rate
at which the screen is updated) is high, so you move smoothly from room to
room, turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky motion of
most 3-D games.  On a 386DX, the game runs well, and on a 486/33, the normal
mode frame rate is almost as fast as television.  This allows for the
most important and enjoyable aspect of gameplay: immersion.

(3-9): New Monsters and Artificial Intelligence
===============================================
        Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed rooms.  When
you open a door, the guards get a chance to see you and opening the door
connects your sound area to the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will
be heard in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this kind of
action.  In DOOM it's much more complex.  DOOM isn't made up of a bunch of
rooms; it's a cohesive world.  You might blast your shotgun and the sound
could travel through a window or slime-river tunnel to another entirely
different area and alert some monsters.  Then, they'll come looking for
you!  Opening doors, going down stairs, wading through slime, etc.  You are
still able to get the drop on them from behind, just like in Wolfenstein
3-D -- but you have to be sneakier about it.
        There is a huge amount of new enemies in DOOM.  Here is a list:

        FORMER HUMANS (dudes in filth-covered combat suits):  Just a few days
ago, you were probably swapping war stories with one of these guys.  Now it's
time to swap some lead upside their head. They are the weakest of all
enemies.

        FORMER HUMAN SERGEANTS (dudes in black armor, also filthy):  Same as
above, but much meaner and tougher.  These walking shotguns provide you with
a few extra holes if you're not careful!

        IMPS (brown thorny hominids):  You thought an imp was cute little
dude in a red suit with a pitchfork.  Where did these brown bastards come
from?  They heave balls o' fire down your throat and take several bullets to
die.  It's time to find a weapon better than that pistol if you're going to
face more than one of these S.O.B.s.

        DEMONS (pink horrors, vaguely humanoid):  Sorta like a shaved
gorilla, except with horns, a big head, lots of teeth, and harder to kill.
Don't get too close or they'll rip your fraggin' head off.

        SPECTRES (vague, half-formed shapes):  Great.  Just what you needed.
An invisible (nearly) Demon.

      + LOST SOULS (flying skulls): Dumb. Tough. Flies. On fire. Flying
skills with a hot temper. They like to go for a screaming head-on
collision.

      + CACODEMONS (gigantic floating one-eyed heads):  They float in the
air, belch ball-lightning, and boast one Hell of a big mouth.  You're toast
if you get too close to these monstrosities.

        BARONS OF HELL (you'll know `em when you see `em):  Tough as a dump
truck and nearly as big, these goliaths are the worst thing on two legs since
Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Watch out for the green plasma they fling at you.

      + CYBERDEMON (rocket shooting colossus):  When you get to the end of
the second episode, you'll know.

      + SPIDERDEMON (huge robotic chaingun shooting spider):  It will make
you wish you never were playing DOOM in the first place.  Watch for it at
the end of the third episode.

+:  Not found in the shareware version

[3-10]: Weapons
===============
        Here's a list of weapons that are in DOOM.  Don't try using these at
home. :)

        (1) Fist

[3-10-1]: What does BFG9000 stand for?
--------------------------------------
        Being the most powerful weapon, the only thing BFG9000 could stand
for would be "Big Fraggin' Gun." :)

[4-1]: How can I contact id Software?
=====================================
        id Software can be contacted via the Internet.  If you would like to
ask any questions about DOOM (that are not answered in here), send E-mail to
"help@idsoftware.com".  Id Software can also be reached at their 800 number.
The number is (800)-ID-GAMES.  This number is for ordering games ONLY.  This
number is not for technical support or inquiries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]: What are the differences between the different releases of DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*5-1*: What is the shareware release?
=====================================
        The shareware version of DOOM only includes one of the three
missions of DOOM.  Each mission contains eight levels and a secret
level.  The shareware version contains network support and modem
support.  The shareware version does NOT include the Plasma Rifle and
the BFG9000 weapons. On December 10th, 1993, v1.0 was released.  On
December 16th, 1993, v1.1 was released.  On February 17th, 1994, id
released v1.2 of DOOM.  This version fixed many bugs and added new
features, including modem support. Unfortunately, this revision added
many new bugs.  On June 28th, 1994, v1.4 was released.  This version was
only an "Internet Beta version," as was used to find bugs before the
pending released of v1.5 of DOOM.  Then, on July 8th, 1994, v1.5 was
released as another "Internet Beta version."  Both version 1.4 and 1.5
were released without registered version patches. In early August, v1.6
was released as yet another "Internet Beta version." FINALLY! In early
September of 1994, v1.666 made its debut!  The new features of v1.4,
v1.5, and v1.666 are all outlined in Chapter [5-3].

[5-2]: What is the mail-order release?
======================================
        The mail-order release of DOOM includes all three missions of DOOM.
Each mission contains eight levels and a secret level.  This version includes
all weapons.  All mail-order releases ordered July of 1994 are older
versions.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you wish modem
support, Nightmare mode, DeathMatch v2.0, and various other bug fixes.

*5-3*: What makes the six versions different?
=============================================
        Seven different versions of DOOM have been released: v1.0 (which
has the v0.99 operating system), v1.1, v1.2, v1.4, v1.5, v1.6, and
v1.666.  Version 1.0 was the initial December 10th, 1993 release.
Version 1.1 was the first upgrade of DOOM, released on December 16th,
1993.  Although this version fixed many bugs and compatibility problems,
it introduced many new ones. Version 1.2, released on February 17th,
added modem play, Nightmare mode, and better use of networks, but again
introduced many new bugs.  v1.4 of DOOM was a Beta version released
exclusively on the Internet, and was only used for finding bugs before
the pending v1.5 release.  v1.5 followed, which again was released as an
Internet Beta version to find bugs for the pending v1.6.  v1.6 was then
released as another Beta, and finally v1.666 was released in early
September which fixed some modem play problems and other miscellaneous
sound code and control bugs.

        v1.4/v1.5/v1.666 new features:

        - New 14.4k and 28.8k modem support
        - Better serial support
        - New and improved SETUP.EXE with the following features:
                + Phone number list
                + Modem string database
                + Level warp key (F1)
                + Up to eight digital channels instead of four
        - New DeathMatch v2.0 rules (-ALTDEATH parameter):
                + All objects respawn after 30 seconds
                + Suicide subtracts a frag from your score
                + Negative frags are now possible
        - You can type "+" and "-" in chat mode
        - The "Official" DOOM FAQ is now included
        - Microscopic map bugs fixed and some elements changed in certain
          maps for network play
        - Recording multiplayer demos is now possible
        - Recorded demos do NOT end when you die or when the level ends.
          You must press "Q" or quit from DOOM to halt recording.  The
          default demo buffer is 128K, but it can be increased by using
          the "-MAXDEMO <#k>" command-line parameter.  "-MAXDEMO 1024"
          would allocate one megabyte for a demo recording buffer!
        - When playing back Multiplayer demos, you can use F12 and TAB
          keys to access the other player's views and watch everyone
          on the automap.
        - You can NOT use external files with the shareware version any
          longer.  You must register first.
        - You can now reload maps using the IDCLEV<e#><m#> cheat if you are
          map editing on a LAN
        - Supports RESPONSE files for up to 100 command-line arguments.  A
          response file is a text file that contains all the command-line
          arguments you which to pass to DOOM.  An example would be:

            ---- start of file ---- (don't type this line)
            -nomonsters
            -deathmatch
            -altdeath

            ---- end of file ---- (don't type this line)
          If you name this file RESPONSE.TXT, when you invoke DOOM, you
          would type "DOOM @RESPONSE.TXT" and add any additional
          command-line parameters afterwards.
        - Sound Blaster AWE32 sound support
        - Sound does NOT work under Windows or OS/2 yet.  A new version is
          being test and will be released when it is stable.
        - new FAST parameter allows optional fast enemies
        - new TURBO parameter allows the marine to move more quickly
          (this is considered cheating and is only meant for DeathMatch play)
        - the DEVPARM parameter is no longer needed to record demos

        NOTE: Saved games from versions before v1.666 do not work with v1.666.

        Bug fixes since v1.5:

        - Miscellaneous sound code, serial code, and control fixes
        - IDKFA and shotgun no longer crashes the game

        Bug fixes since v1.4:

        - SERSETUP has been rewritten-- AGAIN!
        - Help screen now mentions F11:Gamma Correction.
        - Sprite graphics can now be used in PWADs.
        - A bug that caused some monsters to teleport outside of the levels
          has been corrected.
        - Mysterious DeathMatch bug (since v1.0) that caused random objects
          to reappear but not be gettable has been corrected.
        - Increased 64K of savegame buffer space for PWAD developers.
        - SERSETUP COM port setting > 38400 has been fixed.
        - Response file bug fixed.
        - SETUP lets you type ENTER for a control key.
        - New GUS instrumnet mapping file for 1mb GUS cards only.

        Bug fixes since v1.2:

        - Now more than two people can play over a network without crashes.
        - No more PS/2 mouse bug (player loses control of character,
          character spins, game locks, etc.)
        - Saving a game under a open door, restoring it, then pressing
          space no longer causes the game to crash.
        - Sound code rewritten.
        - Serial game difficulty selection fixed in SETUP.EXE.
        - map bug fixes including two-sided linedef bug and faulty
          SKY1 ceiling texture mapping
        - gun projectiles (rockets, plasma, rockets) will no longer trigger
          linedefs

        It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 if you have not already
done so.

*5-4*: What is the commercial release?
======================================
        The commercial version of DOOM is called "DOOM II: Hell on
Earth" and will not be released in stores until October 10th, 1994.
        DOOM II is finished and is now available to registered users of
the original DOOM.  It can be ordered directly from id or from GT
Interactive Software at 1-800-332-4300.  It costs $44.95 per copy.
        DOOM II will include these features:

        * Chaingun dude. Kill him & pick up his weapon!
        * Archvile: Resurrects dead demons and does a Hellfire attack on ya!
        * Fatso: Shoots triple high-speed bruiser-damage shots, but moves
          around pretty slowly
        * Pain Elemental: A gray/brown Cacodemon that shoots Lost Souls! When
          you kill him, 3 Lost Souls birth from the goo!
        * Hell Knight: A weaker, lighter-colored version of the Baron of Hell
        * 30 levels
        * Lots of graphics
        * All new music
        * More sound effects
        * Runs a little faster than original DOOM due to further code
          optimizations!
        * Totally killer DeathMatch-designed levels!

(5-5): I bought DOOM in a store, is it illegal?
===============================================

        Here is accurate information regarding DOOM's legality.

        (1) DOOM purchased directly from (800)-ID-GAMES is NOT illegal.
        (2) The registered version of DOOM purchased in ANY retail stores
within the United States is illegal.
        (3) The registered version of DOOM purchased on CD-ROM ANYWHERE
is illegal.
        (4) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores
OUTSIDE of the countries listed below is illegal.

                Australia
                New Zealand
                Hong Kong
                Taiwan
                Singapore
                Netherlands
                UK

        (5) The registered version of DOOM purchased in retail stores in
Canada is illegal.
        (6) The shareware version of DOOM purchased anywhere (on CD-ROM

        I hope this clears it up.  If you own an illegal copy of DOOM,
please E-mail to "help@idsoftware.com" to report the distributor,
date of purchase, and price.  Calling (800)-388-PIR8 is also allowable
for people without Internet access.

[5-6]: What is the Jaguar release?
==================================
        Shawn Green of id Software has been gracious enough to indulge a
nearly constant barrage of questions concerning the upcoming Jaguar version
of DOOM.  The Jaguar is a 64-bit game cartridge system.

   -  Comlynx will be supported.  (2 Player: Jag to Jag communications)

   -  The game will be presented in 16 bit color (possibly - see next item).

   -  The final frame rate is expected to clock in at around 15-20 FPS.
      If ID reverts to 8-bit color (as in the PC version) 20 FPS is definite.
                The advantage is a little bit faster frame rate.
                The disadvantage is loss of color depth.

   -  The game will have digital music and (digitized?) sound effects.

   -  Game levels will be slightly different than the PC version.
      ID will take the best 20 levels from the PC version (all three
      episodes) and perform minor optimizations for speed. Included
      in the twenty levels will be a secret level.

   -  JagDoom will support automatic regeneration of monsters.  (After the
      enemy dies, he comes back again. And again. And again. Etc..)

   -  Save Games will come in the form of a password. All of the stats will be
      saved except for the location within a level.  Upon restoring game stats
      from a saved game, you will be placed at the beginning of the level.

   -  NO RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  Folks, don't
      bother the id concerning a release date.  They have a VARIETY
      of projects on the burner, and will get JagDoom out as soon as
      they are able.  Shawn says, "A Summer release is feasible."

   -  NO PRICE HAS BEEN MENTIONED.  Cart memory is NOT cheap, and I'm
      sure this is a constraint that ID is struggling with as they work
      on the Jag version.

        Once again, I want to caution that this is PRELIMINARY information.
The DOOM engine is running on a Jag development system, but it has a
long way to go before it's ready to ship for manufacturing.  The info
presented here reflects how the game may LIKELY end up, but cart cost
is (sadly) a major concern when the game is being finalized.

*5-7*: What is WinDOOM?
=======================

        Here is the latest information on WinDOOM, direct from Microsoft.

- WinDOOM is a joint effort of id Software and Microsoft.  Microsoft is doing
  most of the porting work.
- WinDOOM is a Win32 application.  It runs under Windows NT and Windows 4.0.
- WinDOOM uses the recently announced WinG libraries.
- WinDOOM supports full music and sound and supports all Windows MIDI and
  WAVE devices.
- WinDOOM has variable resolution.  WinDOOM can render the display at
  320x200 through 640x400.  Resolutions greater than 640x400 are
  performed via "stretching" (this is a limitation of the DOOM engine)
- WinDOOM supports network play via WinSOCK (TCP/IP) and NetBIOS (NetBeui,
  IPX, etc.)
- WinDOOM supports any display with at least 256 colors.
- WinDOOM is multithreaded so if you're running under a multiprocessor
  machine you'll see a significant speed increase.
- WinDOOM will support DEC Alpha and MIPS RISC machines.

*5-8*: What are DOOM ports are in the works?
============================================
        Here is the status on all the latest DOOM ports.

OS/2: Still working, no dates yet. IBM guys are handling this.
This is how this will work: You will be able to download the
OS/2 version from most BBSs and ftp sites. It will work with
your registered wad or the shareware one. NO CHANGE.

SGI Irix v5.2:  ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/msdos/games/id/sgixdoom.tar.Z.
It is integrated with the v1.6ish DOOM version.  It supports
pixel-doubling, -tripling, -quadrupling as well as 16-bit sound
for clearer mixing.  Now compiled with -mips1 flag.

LINUX: Same as Irix version. Not finshed yet. Out later, though.
This will also be available from most ftp sites.

JAG: Running very fast. Lighting is working now. This will be out
later this summer probably September. We are doing this. There
will be two new levels in the Jag version. The graphics are
getting faster every day.

MAC: We have found a team to do this. There is no release date. No
development has begun. We just got some Power PCs to test the beta
version on. It should be here soon. Please do NOT ask to test
this. There is no more info on this at this time. NO CHANGE.

CHAPTER [6]: Where can I get DOOM?
----------------------------------

        Note: Unless you are an official id Software Beta-Tester, any
Beta version that you may have in your possession is a violation of U.S.
federal copyright laws.  Additionally, it is illegal to make copies of
the registered release of DOOM.  Violation of these laws can result in
fines of up to $250,000 and jail terms of up to 5 years.  If you are in
possession of a Beta version, it is suggested that you delete your copy
immediately.

----------------------------------------
CHAPTER [7]: What is needed to run DOOM?
----------------------------------------

[7-1]: What is REQUIRED to run DOOM?
====================================
        DOOM requires a 386sx IBM compatible computer running MS-DOS v3.3 or
higher, VGA (320x200x256) graphics, and 4mb of RAM.  The shareware version of
DOOM needs about 4.8mb of hard drive space.  The mail-order version needs
about 12mb of hard drive space.
        DOOM ports for the Atari Jaguar, Linux/X, Irix/X, Windows, OS/2 PM,
MacOS, SEGA 32X (Mars), QNX, FreeBSD, Solaris, and UNIX are also planned.

[7-2]: What sound cards does DOOM support?
=========================================
        DOOM supports general MIDI, Adlib, Sound Blaster, Sound Blaster Pro,
Sound Blaster 16, Roland Sound Canvas, Gravis UltraSound, WaveBlaster, Pro
Audio Spectrum 16, and compatibles.

[7-3]: What game controllers does DOOM support?
===============================================
        DOOM supports keyboard, mouse, joystick, and trackball (functioning
as a mouse).
        DOOM also supports the Gravis Gamepad and Logitech Cyberman.

----------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER [8]: How can I use multiple players in DOOM?
----------------------------------------------------

        DOOM supports 2-4 players in a multi-player mode. DOOM is
playable over networks, modems and by serial link.

Note: For playing the registered DOOM over networks or by modem, EACH user
      MUST BUY his/her own individual copy of the game.

[8-1]: How does the multi-player gameplay work?
===============================================
        In DOOM, players are able to see each other, and watch each other
jerk in pain as they are hit during the game.  Players are able to watch
others get hurt, die, and move throughout the labyrinth.  DOOM allows
players to play together, working as a team.  In this cooperative mode,
players can see each other on an "automap" and switch to each other's view.
DOOM also allows players to play against each other, in DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-1]: How does pausing, saving, and loading work?
====================================================
        In DOOM, some things change when playing with more than one player.
        When you activate the Options menu or submenus, the game KEEPS
RUNNING so that other players can continue with the action.  So, it is best
to find a safe place before adjusting screen size, sound, etc.
        A player may pause the game by pressing the PAUSE key, but any other
player can unpause the game by pressing the PAUSE key again.  Make sure it is
okay with your buddies before taking a breather.
        When you do a save game during network/modem play, it saves on every
player's system in the save game slot you select, writing over whatever was
there.  Before saving the game, players should agree on a safe slot to save
it in.
        You cannot load a saved game while playing a multi-player game. To
load a game, everyone must quit from the current game and restart the game
from a saved game.  To start a game from a saved game, you can either
select it from the SETUP program or identify it as a command line parameter.

[8-1-2]: What are the different uniform colors for?
---------------------------------------------------
        In network/modem games, each player's uniform is a different color.
The color of your character is the color behind your face on the status bar.
The colors are BROWN, INDIGO (black), GREEN, and RED.
        These are used to identify between players during game play, and
to chat with others using Chat Mode.

[8-1-3]: How does a player see what others are doing?
-----------------------------------------------------
        If you're playing in cooperative mode, press F12 to toggle through
the other players' viewpoint(s).  You still retain your own status bar at
the bottom, and if your view reddens from pain it is YOU, not your partner,
who has been hit.

[8-1-4]: How do players communicate using Chat Mode?
----------------------------------------------------
        In a multi-player game you can communicate with other players in the
Chat Mode.  To enter into Chat Mode and broadcast a message to all the other
players, press the letter "T".  A cursor will appear where your messaging is
normally placed.  To broadcast to a specific player, instead of pressing
"T", you'll need to press the first letter of the player's color: (B)rown,
(I)ndigo, (G)reen, and (R)ed.  For example, to send a message to the brown
character, you would press the letter "B".
        In DOOM v1.2, a macro capability was added.  After defining
ten macros in SETUP.EXE, pressing the player color, and then
"ALT-<macro number>" will send a macro.

[8-1-5]: How do the weapons work?
---------------------------------
        When a player runs over a weapon, he picks it up, but the weapon
remains in the game for other players to take.  Shotguns dropped by former
human sergeants are removed from the game after being picked up or smashed.
        In DeathMatch v2.0 (use the ALTDEATH parameter), weapons are
removed from the playing field from thirty seconds and then reappear when
playing DeathMatch mode.

[8-1-6]: What happens when a player dies?
-----------------------------------------
        If you die and restart in the level, previously taken items and
destroyed monsters don't reappear unless you are playing in DeathMatch
v2.0.  Even though you've died, other players have survived.

[8-1-7]: Can players exchange supplies?
---------------------------------------
        Players cannot exchange supplies.

[8-1-8]: Miscellaneous
----------------------
        In Cooperative mode, each player begins in the same area.  In
DeathMatch mode the players begin in completely different areas--if you want
to see your buddy you'll need to hunt him down.  Plus, each time you die,
you'll start in one of several random locations.
        Unlike in single-player or Cooperative mode gameplay, in DeathMatch
mode the players start at each location with the keys necessary for opening
any locked door in that area.
        In DeathMatch mode the ARMS section on the status bar is replaced
with "FRAG."  The FRAG section displays the number of times you've killed
your opponents.
        In Cooperative mode the Automap works the same way it does in
single-player mode.  Each player is represented by a different color arrow.
In DeathMatch mode you won't receive the pleasure of seeing your opponents on
the map.  Just like the monsters, your friends could be just around the
corner, and you won't know it until you face them.

[8-2]: What exactly is "DeathMatch" mode?
=========================================
        DOOM has a "DeathMatch" mode where every player is out for
himself.  At the beginning, the level is infested with enemies and power-ups.
In this mode, players can't see the other players in the Automap, nor switch
to their view.  Players are not able to view other's health in the mode,
because of the disadvantage this can cause.

[8-3]: How does DOOM work with networks?
========================================
        DOOM supports the IPX (Novell Netware) protocol in the initial
shareware version.  Using this network support, DOOM can be played in a
workplace type environment.
        To start network mode:
        (1) Launch DOOM from the SETUP program, by going to the directory in
which you installed DOOM, typing SETUP, and pressing the ENTER key. Unlike
playing DOOM in single player mode, DOOM in multi-player mode must be run
either from the SETUP program or by using the command line parameters.
        (2) The SETUP program allows you to configure the information that
is necessary for the multi-player game. The SETUP is simple to use.
        (3) Start the game!

*8-3-1*: What are the network command line parameters for DOOM?
---------------------------------------------------------------
-LOADGAME allows you to start DOOM from a specified save game.  Instead of
using the saved game name, simply enter the number (0-5) that corresponds to
the slot you saved the game to on the SAVE GAME screen.
-loadgame <# of the game>

-DEATHMATCH starts DOOM as a DeathMatch game.  If you don't enter DEATHMATCH
as a command line parameter, DOOM will default to Cooperative mode.
-deathmatch

-SKILL sets the skill level (1-5) you wish to play.
-skill <# of skill level>

-EPISODE sets the episode (1-3) you wish to play.  The default episode is
Episode One, Knee-Deep in the Dead.
-episode <# of the episode>

-CONFIG allows you to use your configuration file from any directory you
choose.
-config <pathname> ex. -config f:\doom\data\myconfig.cfg

-NOMONSTERS allows you to start playing with NO MONSTERS running around!
This is great for DeathMatch where, really, the monsters just get in the
way.
-nomonsters

-RESPAWN tells DOOM that, yes, you are a badass, and yes, you want all the
monsters to respawn 8 seconds after you kill them.  The NIGHTMARE skill
level already does this.  Note that using -respawn and -nomonsters at the
same time is a dumb thing to do.
-respawn

-ALTDEATH uses DeathMatch v2.0 mode.
-altdeath

-FAST uses fast monsters, as in Nightmare mode
-fast

-MAXDEMO determines the maximum size of a recorded demo
-maxdemo <size in K>


-TURBO increases the speed of the marine (this is considered cheating in
single player mode and is meant for DeathMatch only)
-turbo <speed increase 1-255)

(8-3-2): How does DOOM determine player colors?
-----------------------------------------------
        The player numbers and colors are determined by the ethernet node
address. The lower the number, the lower number you will be assigned in a
multi-player game.   The lowest number gets green, and the highest number
(with four players) gets red.  To change the player numbers in a net game,
insert the line :"NODE ADDRESS xxxxxxxxxxxx" under the Link Driver section of
your net.cfg before you load LSL.

[8-3-3]: How can I use DOOM on Novell Netware Lite?
---------------------------------------------------
        Here is information on how to play DOOM on a Novell Netware Lite
network.  Novell does not approve of or recommend the following drivers.

HOST/CLIENT (1) Load the LSL.  (LSL.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (2) Load your card driver.  (example: 3C5X9.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (3) Load your server.  (SERVER.COM)
HOST/CLIENT (4) Load your client.  (CLIENT.COM)
CLIENT      (5) Log into the network.
CLIENT      (6) Map the hosts to the hard drive.  (refer to NWL Manual)
HOST        (7) Run DOOM's SETUP.EXE, configure, and press F10.
CLIENT      (8) Change to mapped DOOM directory, and run SETUP.EXE,
                using the same options as used on the host.
            (9) PLAY DOOM!

Note: It is illegal to use the Registered DOOM on only one server.  You
      must buy a seperate copy of the game for each player.

[8-3-4]: How can I use DOOM on other types of networks?
-------------------------------------------------------
        It does not matter what type of network you use for DOOM, whether it
is Lantastic, Windows for Workgroups or other networks.  netDOOM uses the
cards at such a low level that it does not need the network services.  It
only needs the ODI/IPX drivers.
        This being the case, netDOOM works fine with any Ethernet or any
other cabling system. Naturally, you can not use any normal network services
at the same time.

        There are a number of ways of getting IPX working with a given
ethernet card.  One is to use a dedicated IPX driver for the card,
another is to run an IPX converter over some other standard such as
NDIS, ODI, or the packet driver standard.  If one method fails to
work, try another one!  I have had good reliability with the IPX
over Packet driver method, though it can sometimes be a challenge
to get it running...  If you are already using Novell, then the IPX
over ODI might be simpler to set up, though I have found it less
reliable.

        Before I get going, let me plead with everyone NOT TO USE DOOM 1.1
OR 1.0 ON ANY NETWORK OTHERS ARE TRYING TO USE!!  Doom 1.6 is now
available, so please use it rather than 1.1 or 1.0.  DOOM 1.0 and
1.1 really screw up networks.

Now that I have all my disclaimers out of the way... :)

        To use this method of installing IPX you need two files, both of
which are in the file PKTD11.ZIP, which can be had from
oak.oakland.edu as/pub/msdos/pktdrvr/pktd11.zip.  I have seen some
problems with this version (11) of the drivers, however, so it
would be wise to test out the packet driver after it is loaded, or
perhaps to try one which comes direct from the ethernet card
manufacturer. (i.e. 3c5x9pd.com from ftp.3com.com)

        If you have problems with these drivers, I have put together a
collection of older versions of IPX and packet drivers which seem
to work better with DOOM.  This package will be uploaded to
ftp.uwp.edu as OLDIPX.ZIP.  (see Chapter [14-6])

        The first file is specific to your ethernet hardware.  It is the
packet driver software that converts packet-driver calls to
commands your ethernet card can understand.  The INSTALL.DOC file
included with the packet driver collection has details about which
cards are supported and what sort of command-line parameters are
needed for each packet driver.  I always load the packet driver
using interrupt 0x60, a popular convention.  These drivers will not
work well under Windows without tweaking, so read the INSTALL.DOC
file for details.  There are also some useful packet utilities
included.  Again details are in INSTALL.DOC.  (Got the hint yet? :)

EXAMPLES:

     3Com 503 card on interrupt 5, I/O port 0x300, and the
     internal transceiver. (twisted pair RJ-45 connector ON
     THE CARD or coaxial BNC connector-- NOT the 15-pin AUI
     connector) The shared memory area is automatically
     determined-- but be sure to exclude the region from your
     expanded memory manager, if used!

          3C503.COM 0x60 0x5 0x300 1

     3Com 509 card: These cards are entirely
     software-configurable through the config/diagnostics on
     your EtherDisk that came with the card.  If you have lost
     the disk, all the needed files are available from
     ftp.3com.com.

          3C509.COM 0x60

     AT&T StarLan cards: Almost like the 503 except the memory
     location must be specified.

          AT&T.COM 0x60 0x2 0x360 0xD000

        Once the packet driver is loaded and reports things correctly
(i.e. it does not give your ethernet address as
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF...) then just run PDIPX.COM to load IPX support.
The PDIPX.COM program is included with PKTD11.ZIP, but it is
contained in a .ZIP file INSIDE of PKTD11.ZIP called PDIPX103.ZIP.
Run the .COM file with no parameters.

        If you have problems with an "invalid mode" when loading PDIPX, you
probably are trying to run other network software at the same time
as the Packet Driver/IPX combination.  Strip down your CONFIG.SYS
and your AUTOEXEC.BAT files to those shown below.  Do not load any
additional TSR's!  Once this bare-bones configuration works, you
can begin adding TSR's.  if your problems persist, try using the
older versions of the packet driver and IPX-to-PD converter.  (They
should be on ftp.uwp.edu.)

        If nothing seems to work, try running the diagnostic program
PKTWATCH.COM after getting everything set up.  If your screen fills
with scrolling multicolor hexadecimal numbers then the packet
driver is working OK.  If it just flashes a cursor at you, then you
have problems UNLESS you are wired directly to another computer.
Hook your computer back up to an active network and see if you can
receive anything then.  If you do not have an active network
available, start DOOM on the OTHER computer while running PKTWATCH
on the original computer.  Of course, the other (sending) computer
needs to have IPX set up as well.

        The simplest way to get all the drivers you need loaded and to
exclude other drivers which may interfere is to create a boot disk
with the correct startup files.  For example:

     CONFIG.SYS
          device=a:\himem.sys
          dos=high,noumb
          files=30
          buffers=30

     AUTOEXEC.BAT
          prompt [DOOM Setup] $p$g
          a:\3c503.com 0x60 0x5 0x300 1
          rem change the above according to your card.
          a:\pdipx.com

        The ONLY line that will vary with what card you have is the
"3c503.com" line.  I encourage you NOT to load an EMS driver since
so many cards use shared memory and it is sometimes difficult to
ensure that the proper area, and only the proper area, is excluded.
DOOM runs just fine with XMS, and you have the added benefit of
loading DOS high to make room for things like mouse drivers.  DOOM
does not NEED XMS to run, though.  Also, I like to change the DOS
prompt to reflect my configuration whenever I am using a bizarre
setup.

        It might be a good idea to also scan your bootable floppy for
viruses BEFORE booting the networked computer with it.  (Scan it on
the NETWORKED computer, not your own...)  There are a number of
common viruses spread by booting computers from infected disks.
(Stoned, Form, and Michelangelo to name a few.)  Let's not give
DOOM a bad name by booting network computers from infected disks!
(btw, F-prot from oak.oakland.edu as /pub/msdos/virus/fp-211.zip is
an EXCELLENT antivirus program. <plug>)

        You must make sure that all of the networked computers using DOOM are
using the same frame type.

[8-3-5]: How can I set up a small inexpensive DOOM network?
-----------------------------------------------------------
        All that is required for network play is a network card for each
computer, a T-plug for each computer (usually supplied with your network
card), and some cable.  A server is not necessary.  Here is a good supply of
inexpensive eight bit network cards for DOOM play.

Corporate Systems Center                PHONE: (408)-734-DISK
1294 Hammerwood Avenue                    FAX: (408)-745-1816
Sunnyvale, CA 94089

        Brand new 16-bit cards priced at only US$49.00 each.  When calling,
tell your service person that you would like to run DOOM.  Corporate Systems
will send you the cards mentioned here.

[8-4]: How can I play DOOM by serial link?
==========================================
         DOOM works in two player mode by modem or null modem.  The
minimum baud rate to play DOOM is 9600 bps.
        Shareware versions 1.0 and 1.1 do NOT support play by modem or
serial link.  It is recommended that you upgrade to v1.666 of DOOM.
        Using this mode is similar to network mode.
        To use a serial link connection, run the DOOM setup and choose "Run
Network/Modem/Serial Game."  Then, choose the type of connection you plan
to make.  Then, configure the game to your liking, and choose the connect
method.
        Note that to run null-modem game, you must have a null-modem cable
plugged into a serial port on both computers and each computer runs
SETUP.EXE with identical parameters.
        If you are using a modem, you will most likely need to edit the
MODEM.CFG file in the DOOM directory.  The first line of the file is an
initialization string.  Pull out your modem manual, and do the following.

        (1) Find the code that turns off error correction.
        (2) Find the code that turns off data compression.
        (3) Find the code that locks your modem at 9600 baud.
        (4) Find the code that turns off all hardware and software flow
            control.
        (5) Create an "AT" initialization string with all these codes and
            put it into the MODEM.CFG.

        To find an already created initialization string for your modem, look
in Chapter [18-3] of this FAQ.  If one is not listed for your modem, you will
have to dig up your modem manual for the correct settings.
        The second line is a hangup string used when you quit DOOM.
        If you STILL cannot get the modems to connect, both of you should
run your favorite terminal programs, and connect with 9600, no error
correction, no data compression, and NO HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL.  Then just run
SETUP.EXE with the "Already Connected" option in the configuration box.

[8-5]: How can I play DOOM over the Internet?
=============================================

*8-5-1*: How can I play DOOM using IHHD?
----------------------------------------
        Enter IHHD -- the Internet Head to Head Daemon designed by Jim
Knutson.  With this brilliant little piece of code, multiplayer gaming has
soared to new heights.  With IHHD, you'll be able to play Head to Head
against other human opponents all over the world, with the only cost to you
being the regular prices you pay to connect to or use your Internet host.
Best of all, it's free.

        First of all, your host needs to be running UNIX as its operating
system.  If you aren't sure what your host is running for its operating
system, check the information given at the login prompt or send mail to
your administrator.

        Other than that, you should be able to run IHHD with ease.  Your
first order of business is to get the IHHD software.  It is available via
anonymous FTP at "rex.pfc.mit.edu" in the "pub/IHHD/src" directory.

        To get it:

        (1) FTP to rex.pfc.mit.edu  ("ftp rex.pfc.mit.edu" at UNIX prompt)
        (2) At the login prompt, enter "anonymous"
        (3) At the password prompt, enter your E-mail address
        (4) At the command prompt, type "cd pub/IHHD/src"
        (5) Type "binary"
        (6) Type "get dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (7) Type "bye"

        If you followed the above steps, you should now have the
"dialer1.6.4.shar" file in your home directory.  Type "ls" at your host's
command prompt to verify its existence.  If you don't see it, try the
above steps again or call for help.

        Next, if you've successfully retrieved the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file
from the FTP site, you need to prepare the IHHD to run on your UNIX system.
For UNIX veterans, the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file is in fact a shar file, and
contains a makefile for easy compiling on your system.  For the rest of
us, follow these steps to get the IHHD up and running:

        (1) Create a directory to put the IHHD software in.
            Type "mkdir IHHD" at the command prompt.
        (2) Move the IHHD file to the new directory.
            Type "mv dialer1.6.4.shar IHHD"
        (3) Go to the IHHD directory.
            Type "cd IHHD"
        (4) Unpack the IHHD files.
            Type "sh dialer1.6.4.shar"
        (5) Compile the IHHD software to run on your system.
            Type "make"
        (6) You should now see a whole mess of files in the IHHD directory.
            The important filenames you're looking for should be:
                "dialer"
                "tcpdialer"
                "tcpanswer"
                "call"
                "showlog"
        (7) If you've got these, you're cool.  Otherwise, try the above
            steps again, re-retrieve the "dialer1.6.4.shar" file from
            "rex.fpc.mit.edu" using the instructions above, or call for help.

If everything checks out, you're ready to rumble!

Here's how you get connected using IHHD:

        (1) Set up a time to play with another Internet DOOM player.
            Ideally, you should use E-mail to make the prior arrangements.

            Make sure you and your opponent use the same baud rate and line
            settings for your modems.

            Make sure data compression, error correction, and hardware
            flow control on your modem are off.  Look at the modem
            initialization strings section in this FAQ for more help.

        (2) When it's time to play, start your favorite terminal program
            and call up your Internet host using your modem.  Make sure that
            your baud rate and line settings correspond to your opponent's.

        (3) Login to your Internet host normally.

        (4) Contact the other player by sending a short E-mail message
            indicating that you are on the net and ready to play.

        (5) Once you both establish that you're there and ready to go,
            return to your UNIX prompt.

        (6) Type "cd IHHD" to enter your IHHD directory.

        (7) You may have to type "terminal download," if you do not have it
            activated already.

        (8) Type "dialer opponent's.host" to start the IHHD connection.
            For example, if you were playing against knuston@cactus.org,
            you would type "dialer cactus.org" to initiate the connection.

            Another way is to type "tcpdialer opponent's.host" while your
            opponent types "tcpdialer -answer".  Or reverse roles, where
            you type "tcpdialer -answer" while your opponent types "tcpdialer
            your.host".  Don't ask me what the difference is; I don't know.

            So, to recap, there are two methods of IHHD connection.
            Method 1: dialer.  You each type "dialer other.guy's.host"
            Method 2: tcpdialer.  One of you types "tcpdialer other.guy's.host"
                      while the other types "tcpdialer -answer".

        (9) Regardless of which method you use to connect, type short text
            messages followed by a carriage return until you see your opponent
            acknowledge you.  Unless you have "local echo" set to ON in your
            serial settings, you will not see the text you type.

       (10) If you don't see your opponent after a reasonable amount of time,
            exit dialer or tcpdialer by pressing "CTRL-C" (i.e. hitting
            the "CTRL" and "C" key simultaneously.)  Contact your opponent
            again by E-mail and agree to try the other method of
            connecting.

       (11) If you're connection looks fine and your opponent has acknowledged
            you and you have acknowledged him, exit your terminal program
            and change to your DOOM directory.  Run SETUP.EXE, and select
            "Run Network/Modem/Serial Game."  On the next menu, choose
            "Modem."  Finally, configure all of the options to your liking,
            select "Already Connected," and press F10.

       (12) If everything goes well, DOOM will start up and bring you to
            your first game over the Internet!  Congratulations, you are
            now connected by IHHD.  You can now proceed to play DOOM as if
            you were connected via a regular phone line.

        If you are having trouble getting DOOM to work with your modem, you
may want to download one of the many third-party serial drivers for DOOM.
(see Chapter [15])

        Unfortunately, because of the nature of the Internet, delays and
warping may occur with your IHHD connection, depending on the quality of the
connection between your and your opponent's host machines.  These delays
are often sporadic, and depend largely on what's going on on the Internet
at that particular times.  Then again, you might just be extremely unlucky
and have a cruddy Internet connection.

        To gauge the quality of the connection, try to "ping" your opponent's
computer from your host.  At the UNIX prompt, type "ping -s opponent's.host".
You should get a listing of "ping times", which you may stop at any time by
pressing "CTRL-C".  Try pinging some other hosts you know to get an idea of
how much ping times vary, and use this data to guesstimate the quality of the
connection between your host and your opponent's.

        Another way to judge the quality of your connection is to simply look
at the other player.  If he's jumping all over the place, you've got a
cruddy connection.  If he's relatively smooth and steady, you've got a good
connection.

        If all else fails, burn incense and sacrifice a beautiful young virgin

*8-5-2*: How can I play DOOM using TCPSetup?
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
             The TCPSETUP DOOMer's FAQ version 1.00
                by Scott Coleman (tmkk@uiuc.edu)
              and Jay Cotton (jay@calc.vet.uga.edu)

     DOOM across the Internet is made possible by a neat little
freeware program called TCPSETUP, written by Jake Page. TCPSETUP
uses the UDP protocol (part of the TCP/IP protocol suite) to send
DOOM game information between multiple machines on the Internet.
It is based on WATTCP, a public domain library of routines
written by Eric Engelke of the University of Waterloo. Although
the authors of this document did not write TCPSETUP, we have used
the program extensively and played iDOOM sessions successfully
with opponents as far away as Estonia (formerly a part of the
Soviet Union). In writing this FAQ, we hope that sharing some of
our experience will make it easier for you to get connected in
your own iDOOM sessions.

Q1: I want to play Internet DOOM. What hardware do I need?

     To successfully play DOOM across the Internet, you will need
the following hardware:

     * A machine capable of playing DOOM (D'OHH!)

     * An ethernet card. And not just any old ethernet card, mind
     you - your ethernet card must be supported by a packet
     driver if you wish to use it to play iDOOM. This document
     assumes that your PC is already equipped with a functional
     ethernet card, although it may currently be in use for some
     other non-TCP/IP function (such as a node on a Novell
     network).

     * A direct connection to the Internet. If there is a modem
     somewhere in the link between your PC and your opponent's
     PC, this FAQ is not for you. Although it is possible to play
     iDOOM over a modem link (either by dialing up to a UNIX
     machine and using IHHD or via SLIP/PPP), such connection
     methods are beyond the scope of this document.


     * A MicroSoft-compatible mouse. OK, OK - so you don't REALLY
     need a mouse to play iDOOM, but it does help you turn more
     quickly, aim more accurately, and STOMP your keyboard-only
     iDOOM opponents... ;-)

Q2: OK, I've got all the hardware. What software do I need?

     In addition to the hardware requirements, some software is
also required to round out your the package. Before you can play,
you'll need to pick up the following:

     * DOOM 1.2 or higher (1.6 beta or higher is STRONGLY
     recommended, since 1.6 seems to have solved some problems
     related to initializing network games). DOOM versions 1.1
     and below are incapable of using TCPSETUP.

     * A packet driver written specifically for your ethernet
     card. The Packet Driver is what lets TCPSETUP (and therefore
     DOOM) "talk" to your ethernet card.

     * TCPSETUP.EXE, the Internet driver for DOOM.

     * The WATTCP Applications (not absolutely necessary, but can
     be useful for debugging and testing your setup).

Q3: Hold it - I don't have some of this software! Where can I get
it?
     * To obtain TCPSETUP: Log on to infant2.sphs.indiana.edu via
     anonymous ftp. Change to directory /pub/doom/multi_doom/net.
     Download the file TCPSET9B.ZIP. Version 0.9B is the latest
     version of TCPSETUP as of this writing. The file named
     TCPSETUP.ZIP is an older version which is both buggy and
     incompatible with 0.9B - make sure you get the newer
     version.

     * Many ethernet cards come with the appropriate packet
     drivers on a utilities diskette packaged with the card. If
     your card does not come with a packet driver, there is an
     excellent collection of freely available packet drivers
     called the Crynwr (nee Clarkson) Packet Driver collection.
     You can obtain it via anonymous ftp from oak.oakland.edu.
     Change to the /pub/msdos/pktdrvr subdirectory and download
     PKTD11.ZIP and PKTD11C.ZIP. The files PKTD11A.ZIP and
     PKTD11B.ZIP contain source code for the packet drivers and
     example programs - you won't need these in order to play
     iDOOM.

     * To obtain the WATTCP applications, ftp to
     dorm.rutgers.edu, change to the /pub/msdos/wattcp/
     subdirectory, and download file APPS.ZIP.

Q4: OK, I've got everything, now what do I do to set it up?

     Setting your computer up for TCP/IP access is very
straightforward. As an illustration, I'll be taking you through
the steps necessary to set up a PC with an SMC ethernet card and
the IP address 128.192.23.5. You'll of course need to substitute
your own specific information in place of the examples given
here. All set? OK, let's get started.

     Step 0: START WITH A CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible. This
includes such things as memory managers (HIMEM, EMM386, QEMM,
etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI). DOOM doesn't need
the former, and the latter will probably conflict with the packet
driver. We recommend that you prepare a boot floppy with a
CONFIG.SYS containing only a FILES=20 line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT
containing only prompt=$p$g.

     Step 1: Set up the packet driver.
     Determine your ethernet card's IRQ setting, it's base I/O
port setting, and it's memory address setting (if any). You
should be able to determine this by looking at the card itself
and consulting the user manual. You'll need some if not all of
this information, depending upon which packet driver you use.
Unzip the appropriate driver from Crynwr Packet Driver collection
archive. In our example case, the packet driver is called
SMC_WD.COM. By looking at the jumpers on the card and consulting
the manual, I determined that the card has been set to IRQ 7,
Base I/O port address 300h, and the base memory address is at
segment d800h. For this example, I have chosen to use interrupt
60h for the packet driver. Packet drivers typically operate on an
interrupt in the range of 60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing
else in my sample system happens to be using the first available
interrupt (INT 60h), I chose that. Thus, to load my packet
driver, I use the following command line:

SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800

where 0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is the IRQ setting
on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and 0xd800 is
the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are in C-style HEX
notation). Don't worry if you don't understand what all this
stuff means - as long as you use the correct numbers, your packet
driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is currently part of a
Novell network (e.g. Netware, Netware Lite, Personal Netware) the
parameters you need can be found in a file called NET.CFG,
usually located in your \NOVELL, \NWLITE or \NWCLIENT
subdirectories (along with all the other drivers needed by
Novell).

     At the very minimum, the packet driver should give a sign on
message and report the ethernet address of your NIC (Network
Interface Card) when you load it. Chances are that if your
ethernet card has been functioning properly for other tasks (e.g.
as a node on a Novell network) then you'll have no problems here.
If not, or if there are any error or warning messages, something
is wrong. One possibility is that one of the settings on your
ethernet card is in conflict with those of another adapter card
in your system. No two adapter cards can have the same IRQ, I/O
port, or memory address settings, nor can the memory areas of two
cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll need to correct the
problem before continuing.

     Step 2: Set up your WATTCP.CFG file.
     Your WATTCP.CFG file contains important parameters used by
the WATTCP TCP/IP kernel. These values MUST be entered correctly
if you wish to make a connection with another DOOM PC. In
preparation for this, you'll need several bits of information.
Contact the network administrator for your site and find out the
IP address for your machine, the IP address for your gateway or
router, the IP address of at least one Domain Name Server local
to your site, and your netmask value. The three IP addresses will
each consist of four groups of digits separated by periods. In
our example, the machine's IP address is 128.192.23.5, the
gateway is 128.192.23.1, the netmask is 255.255.255.0, and the
nameserver address is 128.192.44.67. NOTE: it is important to use
the numeric IP addresses, not the actual host names. NOTE: If you
have other Internet programs currently installed on your machine,
such as Gopher or the Trumpet newsreader, you can probably get
the information you need from the configuration files you need
for those programs (some will even use their own WATTCP.CFG, in
which case you can simply copy it over to your DOOM directory).

     When you have collected all this information, unzip the
TCPSET9B.ZIP file in your DOOM directory. Use your favorite ASCII
text editor to edit the file called WATTCP.CFG. Edit or add the
following lines in WATTCP.CFG:

my_ip=
gateway=
nameserver=
netmask=
MSS=

On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file looks like this:
my_ip=128.192.23.5
gateway=128.192.23.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
nameserver=128.192.44.67
MSS=256

Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

     A short digression: The last line of the WATTCP.CFG file
specifies the MSS, or Maximum Segment Size, used by WATTCP when
sending and receiving IP packets across the Internet. The theory
behind a small MSS is that it can improve throughput in a game
like DOOM, which sends out lots and lots of tiny packets (usually
16 or so bytes in size). The jury is still out on whether or not
this actually helps; however, it won't HURT so I recommend that
you throw it in just in case. Some players who have tried the
MSS=256 trick have reported noticeable increase in speed and
playability of network games; feel free to do some experimenting
and find out for yourself.

     If you know your machine's IP address, but you can't find
out the other values, you can often get away with some educated
guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a subnet usually has an
IP address ending in .1, as is the case with our example. Thus,
if your IP address is xxx.yyy.zzz.www, try setting your gateway's
IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1. As for the subnet mask, a common
value for this parameter is 255.255.255.0. Finally, if you don't
know your nameserver's IP address, you can probably get by
without it for the purposes of DOOM playing. Since you'll be
specifying IP addresses for all of your opponents' machines, a
nameserver lookup won't be necessary to resolve their addresses.

     Step 3: Test your TCP/IP setup.
     Load your packet driver with the appropriate interrupt, IRQ,
I/O and memory addresses. Next, unzip the TCPINFO and PING
programs from the WATTCP apps archive into your DOOM directory.
At the DOS prompt, type:

TCPINFO

and press the <Enter> key. If your WATTCP.CFG values are set up
correctly, and if your packet driver and net connection are
functional, you'll see a couple of screens of information about
your system, including your ethernet address and the parameters
you specified in the WATTCP.CFG file.

     If everything looks OK, the next step is to use the PING
program to attempt to establish contact with your subnet gateway.
At the DOS prompt, type

PING <yourgateway's.numeric.ip.address>

and press the <Enter> key. After a brief delay, you should see a
message telling you that the host is responding, as well as the
round trip time for PING's test packets. If you see the "Timeout"
error message, then something is wrong with your setup; if your
PC is unable to reach your gateway, it will be unable to reach
the rest of the Internet, as well. For our sample system, we
would type:

ping 128.192.23.1

     If your gateway PING was successful, try PINGing your Domain
Name Server (at the IP address you specified in WATTCP.CFG) as
well as some well-known site on the internet (e.g. infant2, which
is at IP address 129.79.234.115). These will test your machine's
ability to connect with other machines outside of your subnet as
well as those outside of your site. All of these PINGs should
result in a "host responding" message with a response time. If
any of these attempts fails, recheck your entries in WATTCP.CFG
and/or get some help from your network administrator. Examples
for our test system:

ping 128.192.44.67

and

ping 129.79.234.115


                   Put Me in, Coach - I'm Ready to Play!

     OK, if you've made it this far, you're now ready for the
main event: an actual game of DOOM! For this first attempt, it's
best to try and find someone on your local network who's willing
to put in a little frag time with you. Connections on your local
net will be faster and less problematic, whereas if you attempt
as long distance connection your first time out, you'll have a
hard time discerning problems caused by distance from problems
caused by an incorrect configuration.

     In general, the players will decide beforehand which machine
will be machine #1, which will be #2, which will be #3, and so
on. Then each machine's command line follows the format

tcpsetup [game options] -net <machine_number> <IP_addresses>

     The IP addresses MUST appear in order, i.e. machine #1's IP
address must appear FIRST in ALL command lines. Machine #2's IP
address must appear SECOND, and so on. The final piece to the
puzzle is that each machine leaves it's own IP address out of the
list. The result is a set of command lines like the following:

tcpsetup [options] -net 1 <machine2> <machine3> <machine4>
tcpsetup [options] -net 2 <machine1> <machine3> <machine4>
tcpsetup [options] -net 3 <machine1> <machine2> <machine4>
tcpsetup [options] -net 4 <machine1> <machine2> <machine3>

     Note that machine1, machine2, machine3, and machine4 are the
numeric IP addresses of each respective machine in the iDOOM
session.

     In our example scenario, the computer is part of a local
area network in a computer lab. Thus, there are identical
machines sitting immediately beside my test machine, with IP
addresses one off from my own, i.e. the test machine has IP
address 128.192.23.5, the machine to the right has IP address
128.192.23.6, and the one to the left is 128.192.23.4. After
stepping through the basic configuration process outlined above
on the other test machines, my frag buddies and I are ready to
begin. On my machine, which we decided will be machine #1, I
type:

tcpsetup -deathmatch -net 1 128.192.23.6 128.192.23.4

The guy to my right, whose machine is #2 and whose IP address is
128.192.23.6, types:

tcpsetup -deathmatch -net 2 128.192.23.5 128.192.23.4

And finally the guy to my left (machine #3, IP address
128.192.23.4) types:

tcpsetup -deathmatch -net 3 128.192.23.5 128.192.23.6

     After we all hit <ENTER>, our machines display "Looking for
a Node..." then "Found a Node!" and after that the usual DOOM
startup information. Shortly thereafter, the screen melts away
and there we are, in E1M1, pistols at the ready!

     Give your buddies a good thrashing - you've earned it! Now,
after you've gotten DOOM working on your own subnet, you're ready
for the final step. Find a partner who is also capable of playing
Internet DOOM. Watch the posts in alt.games.doom, or tune into
the #doom or #tcpdoom channels on irc. You and he will negotiate
game parameters, such as which map to play, which skill level,
and so on. You'll also decide on who will be -net 1 and who will
be -net 2 (experienced DEATHMATCHers will often try very hard to
avoid being -net 1, since that player's uniform is colored day-
glo green and is easier to spot in a DEATHMATCH). Now simply add
the parameters you've agreed on to the tcpsetup command line you
used before, making sure that the -net <n> <etc.> is the LAST
thing on the command line, and that the entire command line does
NOT exceed the 128 character limit imposed by DOS. A typical
command line will look something like

tcpsetup -skill 5 -nomonsters -deathmatch -net 2 128.192.55.666


                         Oh Oh - It's Not Working!

     OK, so you've done everything, just like I've shown you, but
you're still having problems. The following are some suggestions
to try in case of trouble.

     Q: My machine keeps looking for a node forever.
     A: TCPSETUP searches for other game nodes in a very specific
way: It starts searching for the LAST player first, and then
works its way backward. Thus, if you try to start a 4 player net
game, but the 4th player has problems, NOBODY will find ANYBODY
ELSE. This behavior can be very misleading and confusing to those
caught unawares.

     Q: I keep seeing this ICMP: port unreachable message on my
screen.
     A: This message is generated by the other machine when the
port being requested by the sender is unavailable (in use) by the
destination. I've seen this happen in some cases when I started
looking for a node before the other player did. Once the other
player began looking for a node also, the ICMP: messages went
away, and the game linked up normally. If you see this message,
you might also want to try using a different port (see the
TCPSETUP documentation on the -port command line parameter).

     Q: The music starts up fine, but all I see is a BSOD (Black
Screen of Death).
     Q: My machine displays "sending network start info" or
"listening for network start info" and then locks up.
     A: TCPSETUP uses UDP packets to exchange game information
between all machines in the game. UDP packets are not guaranteed
to reach their destination, and there is no mechanism for the
sender to even be informed that what he sent never made to the
destination machine. DOOM has its own internal error detection
and correction schemes, so this ordinarily isn't a problem -
EXCEPT, apparently, at game startup. For whatever reason, DOOM
appears to be extremely vulnerable to dropped packets during the
game startup arbitration. This can result in some machines
getting as far as "sending network start info" but never getting
a response (if the response packet was lost) or in a node
"listening for network start info" forever, since the network
start info packet fell into a bit bucket somewhere along the way.
One thing to do is make sure that you're waiting long enough
before giving up and declaring your machine locked. In some
cases, especially those involving multiple players and/or long
distances, it can take quite some time for all machines involved
to sync up. Give it a full minute before you give up.

 In some cases a machine will even get as far as clearing the
graphics mode screen and starting up the music track, but will
lose the game at that point.

     Q: What does "game mode indeterminate" mean?
     A: The author has only seen this error message once, on a
VERY long distance connection attempt. The two ends found each
other quickly, went through the entire startup sequence, only to
have DOOM dump out immediately to DOS with the above error
message. Upgrading both ends of the connection from the DOOM 1.5
beta to the DOOM 1.6 beta resulted in a successful connection.

[8-6]: How can I setup DOOM to be played on a multi-player BBS?
===============================================================
     Applied Personal Computing, Inc. has recently developed a platform that
allows almost any multiline BBS to host 2-4 player network DOOM games.

     The APCi MultiPlayer Game Server allows gamers to create a simulated
IPX network just by dialing the host BBS at high speed.  APCi MultiPlayer
Game Client software makes use of the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server very
intuitive for even the newest user of online services.  Best of all,
all APCi MultiPlayer Game Client software is FREEWARE and includes any
and all information desired about the supported game.

     For more information regarding the APCi MultiPlayer Game Server, or to
witness the APCi MPGS in action, call the APCi BBS at (618) 632-7664.  You
may also contact APCi at 1-800-535-APCi.  More information can also be
requested from Kevin Sawyer (sawyerk@delphi.com).

(8-7): Where can I find multi-player partners?
==============================================
        A good place to find people to play with is on Usenet is the
"alt.games.doom" newsgroup or on IRC on the #DOOM channel.

CHAPTER [9]: How can I cheat in DOOM?
-------------------------------------

[9-1]: What are the DOOM cheat codes?
=====================================
        Here is a list of the cheat codes from DOOM.  During play, just type
the codes in with the keyboard.  You need not hit ENTER after the code.
After entering, a message should be displayed at the top of the screen
telling which cheat mode was activated.

idbehold        Displays menu (followed by S, V, I, R, A, or L for choice)
                        S=Strength (Berserk)
                        V=Invulnerability
                        I=Partial invisibility
                        A=Full Automap (computer map)
                        R=Anti-radiation suit
                        L=Light amplification visors
idchoppers      Gives you the chain saw (long story behind the message)
idclev          Warp (followed by episode number and level number)
iddqd           Degreelessness mode (God mode)
iddt            Toggles Automap between normal, full, and full with objects
                (enter when in Automap mode)
idkfa           Very Happy Ammo (full ammo, 200% armor, all weapons & keys)
idmypos         Displays your bearing and coordinates in hex
idspispopd      No clipping (you can walk through walls)

*9-2*: What command line parameters exist?
==========================================
        To use most of these parameters, start DOOM by typing:
"doom -devparm <parameter> <more parameters>".  If the "-devparm" parameter
is not needed, the parameter will be marked with a plus (+).  Most of these
parameters can be mixed and matched to create different effects.  For
instance, typing "doom -devparm -wart 1 8 -record demo01 -respawn" would
record a demo on episode one, level eight, with monster respawn.  Lastly,
typing F1 during development mode will allow a 256 color screen capture in
PCX format.

    Then, set up the left and right terminal monitors next to the middle
    monitor, in a virtual-reality type configuration.  When you turn your
    head, you see the screen turned 90 degrees!  This ONLY works with
    versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 of DOOM.

#: For the "-playdemo" and "-timedemo" options, if you give an LMP file name
   of "demo#" (i.e. "demo3"), then that internal demo will be played if the
   external LMP file is not found.  For example, to play the internal 1.6
   shareware demo #2 (multiplayer demo), type "doom -playdemo demo2".

(9-2-1): What do the dots that appear in development mode mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------
        Direct from id, the final formula for calculating the frame
rate that the dots represent has been determined.  The formula to convert
dots to frames per second is:

                                 70
                        --------------------

--------------------------------------------

        This chapter is full of spoilers for people who are "stuck" in the
game.  Enjoy!

[10-1]: Where are the DOOM secret levels?
=========================================

[10-1-1]: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------
        You must be on level three to access the secret level in DOOM.
First, there is a room with an elevator with armor on it in the northwest
corner of the map.  Press the red button in this room. This opens a corridor
in the room where you can see a glowing sphere.  The room it leads to has
some lighted alcoves.  Walk up the stairs.  You should be able to hear a
mechanical sound.  This is the sound of two alcoves being lowered.  The map
looks similar to this drawing.  (I love the beauty of ASCII art)

                        Alcove 1 /\ /\
                                 \/    \
                                /   /\   \
                              /     /  \   \
                            /   /\/      \   \
                            \   \        /   /
                            /\   \    /    /
                            \/ \   \/      \
                        Alcove 2 \     /\    \
                                   \/     \    \
                                            \    \
                                              \ x
                                             ENTRANCE

        Walking into this room normally, the alcoves rise before you can see
them.  But, if you run up the stairs to one of the alcoves fast enough,
you can get in it and rise to a secret door.  Alcove 2 leads to the
blue glowing sphere.  Alcove 1 leads to an island surrounded by ooze.
You can get a rocket launcher here.  In alcove 1, follow the ooze down
the tunnel.  The tunnel leads to a switch that raises the bridge over the
opening ooze pit.  A secret door is also near the switch, but the bridge
leads to the secret exit.  REMEMBER TO >BOOK< TO THE ALCOVE! :)

[10-1-2]: The Shores of Hell
----------------------------
        When you get to Command Center, walk out the elevator door, and
turn right.  Walk up the stairs in the far right corner.  At their top of
the stairs, enter the door to the right.  Walk to the end of the hallway.
Open the door, and look to the right.  Open that door and turn the switch
immediately on the right in that room.  That switch raises stairs in the hall
you just left.  Walk up those stairs, get through the red curtain, and get on
the transporter.  Kill the lost souls in the room you are transported to
and open the hidden door there (a lion head marks it).  Again use the
transporter, and you will find yourself walking towards a marked EXIT-door.
Enter and turn the switch!

(10-1-3): Inferno
-----------------
        The process of getting to the Inferno secret level is probably one of
the most creative things in DOOM, and the most difficult to figure out.  The
way to get there is from level 6, "Mt. Erebus".  You must get inside a blue
box with no ceiling which is in a large triangular depressed area with
"water" at its bottom.  Inside it is a skull switch ending the level. Getting
inside the box counts as one of the secret passage units for the level.  Next
to the box is a large red building which one can get on top of.  To get on
top of it, you must use the secret teleporter in the building with the
berserk pack and stairs in it, with the four Imp cages by the entrance.  For
specifics, the teleporter leading to the ledge above the blue box is located
at <0x27ed486,0x2315201>.  Upon entering the building, you will see a secret
opening to the teleporter on the left.  The teleporter takes you to a ledge
on the top of the red building.  If you go to the right along the ledge you
will be looking down at the blue box.  Unfortunately, the distance is too far
to jump.  The key is to shoot a rocket at the ledge wall, the explosion of
which will throw you into the box!  The area on the ledge where you want to
fire the rocket at the wall is located at <0x375bead,0xa900072>.  There is a
rocket launcher on the level, on a platform out in the open with a chaingun
and a bunch of monsters.  Finally the exit inside the blue box itself is
located at <0x37f436d,0xc1ffa3c>.  You will take a lot of damage in the
process, even with lots of armor and health, however, there are a few
invulnerability artifacts on the level which will protect you.  One is next
to the wall where the launcher and chaingun are, and the other is inside a
central shack that opens when you enter a nearby enclosure to pick up the
green armor.

(10-2): Where are the secret doors in DOOM?
===========================================
        A HUGE thanks to Wouter Slegers, Walter Pullen, and Paul Falstad.
Their never ending attention to making a complete secret list for the
FAQ was invaluable.

NOTES:

        Secrets are marked with an pound sign (#) and non-secrets are marked
with a plus (+). The non-secret descriptions are used to help in solving
levels and the unsolved parts to make the descriptions correct and complete.
        In these new descriptions, coordinates are given in <> brackets.
Your coordinates in the game can be found by typing the cheat code
"idmypos"  (see Chapter [9-1]).  Upon typing this, you will receive a
bearing and the X and Y coordinates.  These will be in the form
"0x<NUMBER>" where "<NUMBER>" is in hexadecimal.  The first coordinate is
the east-west (X) coordinate, and the second is the north-south (Y)
coordinate.  North is at the top of the map, east at the right, south at
the bottom, and west at the left.

*10-2-2*: Knee-Deep in the Dead
-------------------------------

E1M1: HANGAR:

# Just after the zigzag look right for the oddly colored wall <0xBA389D6,
  0xf0e054ec>.  Push it for corridor to a open place with a blue armor vest.
# After you cleaned out the exit room, go back to the zigzag room and look
  right for the shotgun (the tower with the Imp should be lowered now)
  <0xd68473b,0xf2510f63>.
# For DOOM v1.2, a secret area has been added in the above secret room:
  look in the SE corner <0xdeff476,0xf0effdc2> for the elevator.  You'll find
  some armor bonuses up there.  The elevator lowers when you are at the
  entrance <0xb96c465,0xf4879655> in the north, so you'll have to run fast to
  get it.

E1M2: NUCLEAR PLANT:

# The small structure you face when you begin, has a secret door in the SE
  corner (the lighter wall part) <0x15005a8,0x121e8ad>.  Behind the door is a
  room with a red switch.  Pushing that switch will open a secret door in the
  northern corner of the stairs in the east <0x60ada92,0x3affa0b>.  You can get
  outside and collect a supercharger and a chaingun.
+ Behind the red door you'll see a stair twisting to the right.  On the top is
  an indention to your left <0xf9900144,0x3a49ddd>.  If you step on it, it will
  drop down.  You will find enemies to your right, and you will also see (but
  not be able to get) the chainsaw.
# A bit ahead you'll see a lift.  Push the first panel to your left
  <0xf9d0052a,0x5aa56a6>.  You'll be able to kill those Imps from the ridge.
# In the southern part of the maze (to get in, pull the switch behind the pillar
  in the green toxic directly to the right behind the red door <0xfdc004de,
  0x446230f>), shoot the middle most western wall (the one behind the green
  armor vest) <0xf79e0d81,0xfe82feac> for access to the chainsaw (push the
  switch in NW to lower the pillar so you can get it).
  In the same hidden area is some extra armor hidden behind the eastern wall in
  the northeastern corner of the stairs <0xf82fdc62,0x151532f>.
# In the most eastern part of the maze, push the wall between the white stripes
  <0x1eff099,0xfc88d4d4d3> for a backpack.

E1M3: TOXIC REFINERY:

+ The strange grey wall straight ahead beyond the first door you open is a
  secret drawbridge.  The switch for the drawbridge is in one of the chambers
  described below.
# In the room in the NW (the one that opens as soon as you push the red button
  and that contains the yellow key) are TWO secret passages (the second niche
  on your left <0xf3c7ca46,0xf7dfc822> and the second niche on your right
  <0xf5ac3fd1,0xfac4d713>), both will open when you're on the stairs but will
  close again after a (very) short while.  Go to the stairs and then run like
  hell as soon as you hear them lower. It'll help when you shoot the drums that
  might get in the way.
# In the northern niche (leading to a rocket launcher and a green armor) is a
  secret room in the SE corner (just follow the green stuff to the right).
  Run fast for minimum damage.  You'll see a backpack and the switch for the
  drawbridge at the beginning.  To the east is the exit (a lighter colored
  wall part <0xf6aff87a,0xfbd990b9>) through another secret chamber
  containing the chaingun.
# In the south-eastern niche (the second on the right) is a supercharger (pull
  the switch on back of the pillar).
# The drawbridge should be lowered now.  Cross it, but be careful! There are
  a lot of Imps lurking behind automaticaly opening doors.  My tactic is to
  select the chain gun, run forward and back up as soon as you hear the doors
  open.  Then take them out at your leisure.  Note that you can also shoot some
  of them via the secret `window' in the SE <0xf9480573,0xf8b2d736>.
+ In the north of the room is a corridor, follow it to find the hidden-level-
  switch.
# To the north of the room with the hidden-level-switch is a elevator, push the
  wall <0xfbe7f1f6,0xfaafee8c> to lower it, so you can get the rocketbox.
# Behind the blue door in the eastern corner is a secret door (the lighter
  patch in the SE <0xfd6ffcd8,0xf7a33c3b>).  The chainsaw, a supercharger, a
  blue armor and a partial invisibility is available.

E1M9: MILITARY BASE:

You start facing a open space with a cage full of Imps in the middle. The
following rooms are described relative to that cage.

+ In the northeast is a pentagram on the floor.  If you touch it, numerous
  enemies will warp in.  Try walking around it and then running to the
  corridor.  That way you can pick them off one by one.
+ In the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor at the middle of the eastern wall
  <0x75cf281,0x2fa03b> (the highlighted patch on the floor).  To the NE are a
  green armorvest.
# Also in the eastern room is a lift/trapdoor in the SW-corner <0x6102f19,
  0xff10138d> leading to a indoor lake with the chaingun.
# The same area is accessible via the lift/trapdoor in the NE-corner
  <0x3d000fe,fcd013ff> of the southern room.
# In the northern chamber, push the middle eastern wall <0x3efe3b3,0x479d0cd>.
  You'll get into a chamber with several high pillars.  The pillar at the far
  side of the room <0x7ad637b,0x423de32> lowers when someone is on the stairs.
  Just run on it, wait for it to rise, and 'jump' to the other pillars by
  running fast counter clockwise.
+ To get to the end of level switch, run down the trench.  To the NW is a
  isle with the switch and to the south is the lift upstairs.
+ Although they don't count as secrets in themselves, getting on the
  five pillars, each with a weapon or bit of ammo on it, in the secret
  room on the right hand wall of the room with the ooze trench and
  exit, is one of the more challenging things to do in the game.
  Basically, the room on the secret level of episode one "Military
  Base" contains five pillars of increasing height as you go around
  clockwise, along with a lift which lowers when you are on the entry
  stairs, allowing access to the first and highest pillar. The key is
  to go around each pillar in a counter-clockwise direction. Just
  running and jumping toward a pillar isn't enough, as you will go over
  it but fall off the far side, and this can only get you to the first
  and tallest pillar, and the shortest (or maybe the first two on
  either end if you manage to swipe the item off the top of the second
  pillar before falling). The key is to shift+forward run at each
  pillar, take off and jump toward it, and right when you reach it,
  briefly press the down arrow to move backward. This will stop your
  running and you will be standing still on the next pillar. If you
  move back too soon you will hit the pillar and fall to the ground;
  too late and you run off the far side. It's best to give yourself a
  running start for each pillar and line yourself up so you will be
  jumping over the minimum distance possible. Using the automap under a
  high zoom level can help here. This actually isn't as hard as it may
  seem to get right. I understand some can do this all in one fell
  running swoop by turning in mid-routine, but this is a surer way.

E1M4: COMMAND CONTROL:

# The light wall to the left in the beginning (before the door) <0x785a47f,
  0x45005ef> hides a backpack.
# The south exit from the round chamber (the one with the radiation suits)
  leads to a trench.  Follow the trench east for the rocket launcher and a
  supercharger.  To get the supercharger, simply stand on the left side of
  the lift and press the switch.  If you are just barely on the lift, you
  can reach the switch while on the lift.  Follow the trench west to get
  out.

E1M5: PHOBOS LAB:

# The chamber in the middle (behind the first stairs you encounter from the
  start) has a secret chamber to the south (behind the drums) <0x15a4aa6,
  0x1a0025b> with a shotgun.
# In of the east of this chamber is a toxic lake.  In the SE-corner of the
  toxic is a secret passage (the strangely colored wall) <0x466e20d,0x12009bc>.
  There is a rocket launcher and a blue armorvest.
+ In the NW behind the yellow keycard door is a chamber with two pillars and
  an isle with a switch in the green stuff.  In the indention in the west
  <0xf8e024a0,0x34ff9c5> is a secret chamber with the antiradiation suit. The
  south wall of this chamber hides another room with the chainsaw. The south
  wall thereof gives away to let you outside and get the supercharger.
  You can get the blue armor in the NE-corner by stepping on the northern
  pillar when it's down, waiting until it rises again and then 'jumping'
  over.  Ammo can be found by repeating the same action on the souther
  pillar.
# Two platforms with Imps hidden in the walls behind the yellow keycard door
  act as elevator in DOOM v1.2.  The southern one doesn't lead anywhere.
  The northern one <0xfc2fd5ee,0x4f92783> has a secret wall to the east which
  leads to a secret room with a partial invisibility and a shortcut to the
  darkroom (via the north).  The pentagram is a teleporter back to the
  beginning.
# In the north eastern chamber (the one with the blue floor and the blinking
  light) has a secret chamber to the SE <0x52fbab5,0x3d001f3> with a backpack,
  a chaingun and a computer map.
# In the northern darkroom is a partially hidden chamber to the SW.  The best
  way to get there is to follow the wall left.  You'll find the night vision,
  which is very useful in sniping those baddies in the dark.
+ In the northern darkroom the top of the /\ in the middle wall is also a
  secret door, but as far as I can see this isn't really useful (maybe for
  dashing for the exit?)

E1M6: CENTRAL PROCESSING:

+ At the first 'crossing' you encounter, look in the NW corner.  There is a
  partially hidden chamber <0xfd4ff0b2,0xfe5ab835> with some ammo, health and
  a green armor vest.  There are also some Imps there, so to be safe, fire a
  shot into it to detonate the barrels and kill them.
# Behind the red door in the southwest is a green lake.  In the NE-corner
  is an anti-radiation-suit.  In the 'middle' (the tunnel in the SW) is a
  supercharger.  In the SE-corner is a nightvision, a partial invisibility,
  a blue armor and the exit from the lake.
# Just before you are by the blue door there is a secret chamber to the
  south.  Before you're at the blue door, there is a tower with Imps
  <0x31dc6cd,0xfdc354b5>.  When you reach the blue door it will lower so you
  can get in.  You will see an anti-radiation-suit. Push the south wall for a
  backpack, a rocket launcher, a partial invisibility and a back way into the
  room with the yellow key.
# In the same area as where the lowering tower is, is a corridor to the north.
  As soon as you get the yellow key, it will be accessable.  The twisting path
  over the toxic waste will lead to a backpack and a door to the outside. There
  you will see a supercharger on a pillar <0x1125332,0x6c93ef6>. The pillar
  will lower as soon as someone goes near it. Step on it and as soon as it has
  risen, press the wall to the west to get inside the complex again.
+ In the room immediately before the ending room, there is a radiation suit
  available behind one of the pillars.
# In the most eastern corridor is a strangely colored wall <0xd2ffa4f,
  0xf9fc115f>.  Push it to get the computer map.

E1M7: COMPUTER STATION:

# In the southwest is a big pillar <0xfe5cda63,0xf7ff97d9> that will descend
  when you are on the stairs east of it.  Stand on top of it, wait until is
  has risen sufficiently and jump on the ledge in the NE <0xffdfe6c0,
  0xf9237c97> for the computer map or the south lake in the NE corner
  <0xff1e2866,0xf72ffeb0> for the chaingun and (when you leave via the secret
  door to the east) a backpack.  Jump in the lake in the north and run fastly
  to the tunnel in the NW <0xfdf75b77f,0xfa229120>.  In the west of that tunnel
  is a radiation-suit and in the east behind the door with the light are some
  goodies and a switch.  Throwing the switch will allow you to get to the
  chainsaw later on in the room in the extreme SW <0xfacc64c4,0xf5a40aa1>.
  Leave the tunnel via the north and look behind the pillar <0xfea017a9,
  0xfacffbc5> in that lake for blue armor.  Follow the acid to the north to the
  supercharger <0xfdb37a3a,0xffa1e2e2> and leave via the east.
# After you get the blue key in the northwest, two hidden areas will open to
  free Imps and former humans.  The secret room in the middle of the map
  <0x1319742,0xfa50049c> has a false wall to the east which leads to
  outside so you can get a partial invisibility.

E1M8: PHOBOS ANOMALY:

# The only secret room <0x1cfdaa6,0x17bdce1> is in the east in the corridor
  leading to the first door and contains a supercharger.
+ Note that there is a map in the east of your starting point.

*10-2-3*: The Shores of Hell
----------------------------

E2M1: DEIMOS ANOMALY:

# The SE-corner <0x63aba49,0xfdd82d07> of big room in middle (the one with
  the windows to the east, the south and the west) turns into a teleporter to
  the plasma-gun after you pull the switch <0x4e7f923,0xfee0883b> on the outer
  west side and push the button on the west side of the little wall that rises
  out of the floor (the east switch opens the passage to the red key).
# In the SW is a indention <0x31cb145,0xfb50105e> with two skull-switches.
  Press the eastern skull-switch first for access to a teleporter to a
  corridor filled with bonuses in the north.
# Behind the red door <0x186bb69,0xfd97f0a8> is a blue mega armor and the
  computer map.

E2M2: CONTAINMENT AREA:

# If you walk along the south border of the storage area (the one with all
  those boxes), you'll bump into a box <0xff9751f6,0xb101ab0> which will lower
  if you are north of it, to reveal some shotgun ammo.
# In the south east quadrant are three circles with parts of the floor going
  up and down.  The northern one has a secret corridor <0x82ff4df,0x22fd506>
  in the north leading to the blue door in the north, filled with
  life-bonuses.
# In the SW area (with three corridors with the blue lights on the ground and
  ceiling) is a partially hidden corridor <0xff85ce0a,0x6b92713> in the NW
  corner of the most western corridor. When you try to get the backpack, the
  wall behind you will close and the wall in front of you will lower,
  revealing some Imps. The door behind you will open after a while. The
  SE corner <0x2afe532,0x7011ab87> (the black-colored wall) is the
  secret door to a small chamber.  The SE corner <0x3682291,0x6ebaa52>
  of that small chamber (the wall with the small green light) hides a
  corridor <0x4afeea4,9x667fa8e> back to non-hidden territory (the
  lightly colored wall).  The most south part of the corridor
  <0x414d0b4,0x5d0039e> (the black wall part) gives away to a
  computermap.
# In the south middle quadrant is a room <0x1baafb3,0x1d7344b> with two
  pillars, one khaki, one with tubes (to get there leave the three
  corridors with the blue lights via the way you came in.  Turn right
  and first left. The room on your left [east] is the one you seek).
  The west (khaki) pillar <0x31dc5c4,0x2901565> has a switch on the north
  side, with which you can lower the eastern pillar to get the plasma
  gun.
# In the south middle quadrant is a corridor with skull crushing
  doors.  To get by them, run forward as soon as they start to go up.
  Take them one at a time.  The middle one <0x3f4c349,0xff1006b4> (third
  one from either side) has a secret passage in the north ridge, leading
  to the chainsaw.  When you get it lost souls will try to get you from
  hidden rooms in the south and east.
+ The room <0x6ec4d6b,0x3a0ad08> with the yellow keycard in the south
  middle has a bridge hidden under the red blood, following blue lights
  on the ceiling, just walk forward and back again fast to make them
  rise.
# The western room behind the yellow door <0x456db4c,0xdc9ca53> contains
  the chaingun, just flip the switch!
# In the eastern room <0x852f5ab,0xdadd4d9> behind the yellow door
  you'll see three rooms to your right and three auto-rising pillars to
  the north. You can get the backpack on the middle pillar by running
  over the pillar when it starts to rise or later on. The switch on the
  eastern pillar <0x95f38f8, 0x11901ab9> opens the middle door
  containing the rocket launcher.  Flip the switch on the middle pillar
  <0x85ba244,0x11900694> for the south chamber (with ammo) and the one
  on the west pillar <0x75fa7ef,0x11900ad> for the north chamber
  (containing a rocketbox). It's best to pull all switches after each
  other.  Note that the pillars lower as soon as you enter one of the
  rooms, so you can't open any doors after that! (but you can get the
  backpack).
# To get the last secret go into the room with the blue keycard,
  <0x9e4f2bb,0x5affb22> and look up at the four corners.  Note that the
  extreme southeast corner is lit up unlike the other corners. Go and
  stand in this corner and face along the wall.  The platform with the
  supercharge on it will lower <0x9e41c9a, 0x5eff45c>.  Run across and
  get it before it rises again.  It will only go down once, so you only
  get one chance at it.  This is one of the harder secrets in all of
  DOOM to find and get to.

E2M3: REFINERY:
# In the most SW corner of the map is a corridor <0xfba6989a,0xfed0450f>
  to the room with the blue key containing the plasma gun.  To get the
  plasma gun, jump in the red blood and run north (right) fast.
# In the middle south is a room with a five-sided green lake.  The wall
  <0x2847ab9,0xfe90013e> to the south east (the part with between the
  light lines) offers a shortcut.
# The next secret on this level is similar to and next to the one
  above.  You can get out of the room with the green lake
  <0x25ff9c6, 0xfe9f8db4> via a one way secret door on the wall in front of
  the main entry way, which leads back to the room with the imp cage.  The
  other secret door above refers to a one way door into this room which is on
  the wall across from where the rising and falling platforms with candles on
  them are.
# In the south east is a partially hidden cage with Imps
  <0x1de36ff,0x10156d>.  You can enter via the NW corner <0x2effa57,0x951b16>
  to get the backpack.
# Follow the corridor behind the blue door through the open area and the room
  with all those pillars and blinking light to the green toxic stuff.  If you
  go around the corner <0x52fff7d,0x313783c> in the SE, you will find a
  radiation suit.  In the middle of the eastern wall <0x6729d81,0x42cd91e> of
  the green stuff is a corridor to a room with the supercharger in the NE
  corner <0x85000da,0x3eac965>.

E2M4: DEIMOS ANAMOLY:
# In the middle of the south wall <0xfd743e02,0xf5510517> of the beginning room
  (directly opposite to the TL's to the north), hides a room with the shotgun.
# Take the teleporter to big room.  In the north is a elevator.  Press the
  head left of it to go up.  You'll see a green armor and a computermap.
  To get them push the little red pillar <0xadc846c,0xfebfff01> with the skull
  on it in the NE corner.
# To the north of the big O formed by green toxic waste is a secret door
  <0x59bf44d,0xfb6fe831>. It opens if you have walked via the corridor
  <0x75b231a,0xf6c3a683> in the SE of the big O.  There is a supercharger and
  radiation suit. (Don't forget the partial invisibility south to the entrance)
# To the west of the big O with green toxic waste is a corridor with a T to the
  north <0x213d209,0xf9a64b57>. To the east of that corridor is a secret wall
  <0x27fad41,0xfab20726> with a partial invisibility and a chaingun. Shoot the
  wall to get them.
# In the great round corridor in north, behind the blue door: In the east is a
  `dent' <0x4ed2810,0xff5f15c1> in the ring. This is a trapdoor with a secret
  door to the east and leads to a plasma gun and a teleport to the middle of
  the great round corridor.
# In the great round corridor in the north: follow NE corridor to a room with
  lava.
  - The small door <0x62ffe68,0x3b6bde> in the SW leads to a small green lake.
    The SW corner has a blue armorvest behind some drums.
  - In NE corner <0x815a37c,0x2c8c810> behind the lava is a secret door.
  Warning! the SE branch of the corridor behind it leads to a crushing ceiling.
  Outrun it and push the green patch <0xa6ffd1d,0x64560a> in the east for the
  exit. The SW branch lets you go back to the lavaroom.
# In the room above, just over the edge of the wall, is a small ledge
  with some medikits <0x6ff9294,0x22b3e1f> on them which normally aren't
  visible from the room and can be missed when running over the lava to the
  secret door.
# In the south middle behind the place where you find the blue keycard, is a
  small twisty path <0x3550d3b,0xf5c84264> high above the acid.  In the SW
  part of the toxic <0x35019f4,0xf510358a> is a berserker.
# After you open the door to the exit, look back and get the supercharger
  <0x7e9bcac,0xf5497b99>.
+ Note: for those of you still searching for that damn switch so you can get
  to the exit: go in the lake and then towards the exit.  The switch is on the
  right wall of the teleporter left of the exitdoor.

E2M5: COMMAND CENTER:

# The room where the first door leads to has two secret rooms in the space
  between the room and the stairs.  The doors <0xfb80ba93,0x7dbd7cc>
  <0xf8373cba,0x7e031f5> are facing the south and will open automatically to
  reveal Imps and ammo.
+ The ridges <0xfca60096,0x3febfc5> <0xf71000d0,0x3e622b8> of the green lakes
  of the big room south of the begin both lead back to normal territory.
# In the SW is a roughly (--) shaped room.  In the room NW of the middle
  of this (--) is a switch <0xf3efdd28,0x1367f57> which activates a stair so
  you can walk through the fake fire <0xf29412f7,0x18d236d> in the NW corner.
  The teleporter there takes you to an area infested with lost souls.  The west
  wall <0xf4690f4,0x496136d> with the head leads to another room with
  transporter.  That transporter takes you to the switch <0xfe9fb836,0x92ff44b>
  for the secret level.
# In the room east to the room in the south middle with the room to the N,E,
  and W and a view to the circular stairway in the south, is a secret door
  <0xfbaff1cb,0xae3ad8> in the NE corner (near the cozy head-fire) hiding the
  chainsaw.
# In the center of the circular stairway is a anti-radiation suit guarded by
  a demon.  The door <0xf94949db,0xfe6d93d0> to it will open as soon as
  you are at the top of the stairs <0xfa165eed,0xfdd56896>.
# The south door directly after the circular stairway leads to two corridors.
  The eastbound corridor is the way to the exit, the westbound leads to C
  formed green lake in the west.  In the north of that lake is a door
  <0xf1a21e52,0xfe94f08f> (behind the ammo clip).  Follow it to a baron of hell
  in a cage.  North of that you will see a long corridor with three doors to
  the east.  The northern and southern doors lead to a ledge around the lake
  to the east.  The middle door <0xf27dc571,0x826c8a6> (the wall part with the
  pentagram over the ugly head) leads to the isle <0xf5420514,0x823f2c1> in
  the middle of the lake, where you'll find a plasma gun. To activate the
  bridge to the isle, you have to push the button <0xf2aff9f7,0xfd1cd93e> in
  the room in the center of the C-formed lake you passed while coming here.
  BTW: If you fall in the lake, the transporter <0xf42dc0b0,0x7500bcf> in the
  indention in the SW brings you back to the beginning.
# In the slime lake mentioned above, not only is there a teleporter,
  but there is also another niche with a cell pack in it
  <0xf29859a4,0x8bf7c8b>.

E2M9: FORTRESS OF MYSTERY:

There are no secrets in this level.

E2M6: HALLS OF THE DAMNED:
+ In the SE where you find the blue keycard, two rooms with demons will open
  automatically. The SW one has a chainsaw behind the brown wall <0x6362f60,
  0xff151336>.
+ Three parts of the mazes are secret.  All the secrets are off the area at
  the north of the level after going down the long narrow passage to the
  junction.
# The area to the east with the fake exit counts as a secret.
# The area to the north with the goodies on the table counts as a secret.
# The area to the west past the crushing ceiling counts as a secret.


E2M7: SPAWNING VATS:

# In the NW is a corridor with ribbles.  The third indention is a corridor
  leading to a very dark open patch.  In the NE <0x126cccd,0x772feab> is a
  switch which opens a room with a chainsaw.  In the SW <0x32fff5,0x3de1cbe>
  is the plasma gun.
# In the SW is a room with a radiation shield and small patches of green
  acid in indentions along the walls.  The SW indention <0x137b2c8,0xff25986d>
  has a corridor to the south leading to a chamber with a rocket launcher and
  a teleporter.  The teleporter will get you to a red door, with a switch
  <0xffe013c6,0xfd1015b7> behind it.  Pushing that switch will open an
  oute door to a secret room in the beginning-room <0x5d894b7,0x76751d7>
  (SE corner) with a supercharger.  Because this room is protected by two
  doors, a second switch must be flipped to open the second door.
+ To open the inner door, flip the switch that is past the blue keycard
  door, up the stairs, and to the left in the room with the acid pool
  <0x4205835,0x2d00641>.


E2M8: TOWER OF BABEL:

There are no secrets on this level.

*10-2-4*: Inferno
-----------------

E3M1: HELL KEEP

# The small grey chamber before the exit has a secret room <0xfc900da5,
  0x7606912> in west containing the rocketlauncher.

E3M2: SLOUGH OF DESPAIR:

# To get a chaingun, follow the wall to your right (west) to the chaingun
  behind the wall.  The wall will lower when you walk over the red patch
  <0x6b010ab,0x75220b7> to its west side.
+ The second `finger' from the east has some cages with former sergeants.  To
  get into those cages, walk over the red triangle <0x3fa278b,0x817fa0c>.
  The floors of the cages lowers and a wall behind you will come down.
  To lower the triangle column (actually it rises) you want to shoot the
  back wall of one of the six cages the sergeants were in. Shooting it
  raises the pillar exposing the red triangle, walking over which
  lowers the sergeant platforms allowing you to get the stuff in each one.
# In the large circular room at the end of the middle finger is a
  supercharge.
# The plasma gun is hidden in the western part <0x2072324,0x4ecdc0e> of the
  pillar you see when you stand with your back to the second `finger' from the
  west.

E3M3: PANDEMONIUM:

+ In the starting room, a megaarmor can be obtained on a ledge overlooking
  the yard in front of where you start.  When you go up the stairs to the
  right, and then down the elevator to the area which has stairs going down
  to where the blue key is, there is actually a second elevator in the wall
  which leads up to the ledge with the armor.  This second elevator
  <0x48189c,0xfe5f9916> can only be used once, and you must move back
  slightly after pressing the button or else the elevator will catch half way
  up under an overhang.  The armor's ledge does damage so grab it quickly.
+ Directly north of the beginning is a great open place with 4 pillars.
  Pressing the switch <0xfea95756,0xaff327> in the north will lower the middle
  pillar <0xfe921ce9,0xfef4c1db>, so you can get the shotgun.
+ To get to the rooms with the windows to the room in the beginning, go
  north and take both the east and the west stairs, and then south.
# A little north of the middle is a round green lake <0x120905e,0x1754b6d> with
  a lavalike ceiling.  In an indention <0x1c9c5cd,0x1c492ee> in the east is the
  chaingun.
# In the SW is a corridor with two platforms (one in the north and in the
  south).  There is a small corridor in the south.  When you follow it, you'll
  come to a T-split.  In the west (right) is an invulnerability, useful for
  running over the lava in the east. Take the turn left (east).  You should be
  on the southern platform of the corridor.  In the south of that platform you
  can see a lava/blood maze <0xfd9760e5,0x1de4aec>.  In that maze you'll find
  the BFG9000 <0xff1ebaad,0xdeec44> in the SE corner and a supercharger
  <0xfe3afdf3,0x2101114> in the NW corner.  You can also get to the lava maze
  by going directly north from the beginning, then taking the west stairs,
  then following the path north.
# One of the most northern chambers (the one just before the blue door leading
  to the exit) has two air shafts flanking a formation you could describe as a
  coach facing north.   When you stand on the coach <0xff6e17cb,0x532520e> the
  wall part west of the stairs south will lower allowing you to get the map.
  The wall part <0xfffcfa97,0x41c62aa> east of the stairs will lower when you
  push it.
# The last two secrets are in the area to the east of the level, off
  the east hall and over the stairs guarded by lost souls.  Just
  entering the room around beyond it with the lava and Cacodemon counts
  as one secret.  Getting to the area past that with the berserk pack
  and armor counts as another.

E3M4: HOUSE OF PAIN:

+ The first room to the west from the beginning has a secret room <0xfebbbdcd,
  0xc4c579> in the SE corner containing the shotgun.
# In the SW (a bit behind the blue door) is a room with a doors to the east
  (the entrance), to the north (where you find the BFG9000 <0xffdaa1b0,
  0xfd07e1fa> in some lava), to the west (where a lot of Imps and a baron of
  hell await you) and to the south.  The south chamber has a secret room
  <0xff49f58f,0xfae5873e> to the west filled with rockets.
# In the south middle east of the blue door is a room with a door to the north
  and a small patch of blue lake on the east side.  Press the wall <0x3ddce70,
  0xf9d91cc3> a bit more north of that patch of blue for a green armorvest.
+ In the middle is a room with two pillars with switches on all sides.
  Here is a rude ascii-chart of the scene to facilitate solving this.
  [#] is a door opened by switch #
  [Y] is the yellow keycard door
  [R] is the red keycard door
  Behind door 2: an invulnerability

# As drawn above, there is a secret wall <0x6cffeee,0xfdd03be8> in the south of
  the most eastern indention.  It contains a radiation suit.
# The final secret for this level is located to the left of the starting
  room, past the Cacodemon cages and behind the wall.  Using the teleporter
  across the lava to enter the room counts as a secret.

E3M5: UNHOLY CATHEDRAL:

# Take the most western entrance to the cathedral.  Push the west wall
  <0xfc4e8e97,0xfc5dfd80> and get the lightamplifier <0xfad56408,0xfc1fa3ee> in
  the SW corner.
# The most NW chamber (the one with the lava floor) has secret door
  <0xfa4ed057,0x61933f5> to the east with a radiation suit.  The transporter in
  the room leads to the middle of the map/cathedral.
# The east wall <0x2d56f0d,0x9b29c1> of the big central room of the cathedral
  (the one with the four 2x2-teleporters) hides a small niche with a
  supercharger and a chainsaw.  The yellow key is required to open this
  door.
# Also the four stony structures to all sides of the middle warp-in are hollow.
  The doors will automatically open each time you warp in to the middle from
  another place (from outside to inside).
# In the cathedral are four 2x2-teleport-places.  The northern two are
  connected to the north by a corridor.  That corridor has a secret passage
  <0xfd48642a,0x56afd0c> in the NW.
# The most northern room has three switches and a teleport with crushing
  ceilings.
  The SE-switch opens the secret doors in the corridors to the east and west,
  enabling you to get the rocket launcher and some rockets.
  The NE-switch lowers the blue key in the NW-corner.
  The NW-switch lowers the chaingun in the NE-corner.
  The teleporter in the SW teleports you to the NE corner of the cathedral.
# The most eastern room (east of the exit) has a small pit, from where many
  enemies will warp in.  To the east of that room, behind the skull <0x787fd10,
  0x2eaf2e4>, is the BFG9000.
+ For those of you wondering just which damn transporter you have to take to
  get out the middle of the cathedral: it's the most southwestern of the
  northwestern patch of transporters.

E3M6: MT. EREBUS:

+ In the east is a cubus-formed building on a hexagon isle. The east alcove
  <0xd1027ea,0xfe2234b7> is the way in.  In the NW corner <0xb9d75d8,
  0xfeb0d1db> is the backpack.  Pushing the skull <0xbd80026,0xfe22bffe> on
  the west wall lowers the wall in the SE, releasing the enemies trapped there.
  Pushing the skull <0xc5fdf50,0xfe67fb05> on the north wall lowers the wall
  in the NE, so you can get the radiation suit there.
# In the north is a NW-SE oriented structure with two cages with Imps at
  both sides of the entrance.  That structure has a secret door inside in
  the middle of the NE wall <0x3a60e7c,0x356d9b4> (at the small light on the
  floor) and a teleporter in the middle of the SW wall <0x281e808,0x22e23de>.
  The teleporter will put you on a high structure further north.  From
  there you can 'jump' west and get the chainsaw.  You can get out via the
  transporter in the SE side <0x34a6f68,0x9bd1900> of the structure you warped
  on.
# East of the above described NW-SE oriented structure is a small _|_ formed
  building on a small hill.  The building contains two teleporters.  The
  eastern warps you on the NE ridge of the hill, where you can get the plasma
  gun <0x7e352bd,0x1c1c059>. The western transporter also warps you to a ridge
  (NW) of the hill, but there are only some shotgun shells there.
+ The small blue building <0x941bec7,0x293e0bb> in the NE contains a radiation
  suit and cacodemons.
+ All compact flaming red structures contain enemies and a few soul spheres
  or a radiation suit.  Sometimes one of the walls goes down, spilling the
  enemies.
# See Chapter [10-1-3] for information on getting to the secret level.
  This counts as a secret as well.
# The fourth and final secret passage area on this level is inside the
  same building room with the secret teleporter leading to the blue box
  ledge.  On the opposite wall is another hidden wall opening
  <0x3aa61a5,0x365963f> which contains a cell pack.
+ The exit is in the middle west: follow the south wall over the lava, you'll
  see a tunnel <0xfb186e6b,0x54a49e> going north to the blue door, and further
  the exit beyond.

E3M7: GATE TO LIMBO:
# Beyond the northern blue door is a maze of small lava tunnels.  In the SE
  corner <0x7a37332,0x5bec063> of this maze is the BFG9000 and a transporter
  to the SW quadrant of the map.  In the NW is a transporter <0xff7323ef,
  0x824218c> warping to the SW quadrant, the red key <0xfe3f638e,0x6fd04ca>
  and a red door.
+ There are several pillars in the various lava-lakes with red doors, all
  containing transporters:
  (0) In the most SW lake is in the north a pillar <0xf9e908db,0xfc8d60ac>. It
     warps you to a room where you can see the yellow door.  In the same room
     is also a switch <0xfcaffa88,0x45f8a18> on the east wall, pushing it
     activates a bridge in room (1).
  (1) In the middle (big) lake is also a pillar <19c3b9d,362e08> with a
     transporter. It warps you to the room west of the above room.
     In this room is also a yellow door, in it is a switch that activates the
     bridge to the pillar in the middle of a lake (.
  - In the most northern lake are two pillars (east/west). The western pillar
    <ffa72354,6c46d07> has a transporter to the SW ridge looking out over the
    middle pillar..... The switch <f9d003cc,569d8a4> opens a door???
    The eastern pillar <2d380df,57aafc9> leads to the ridge east, with the
    yellow key...
  - SE: 31ff6e7,faea6d2e> NE of tower, with plasma gun.
  - In the NW lake is in the north a pillar <0xfe1aff7a,0x4093707> containing a
    transporter. It warps you to the yellow door.

E3M8: DIS

+ Not a real secret room, but in case you are wondering: the room in the middle
  contains a plasma gun and a blue armorvest.

E3M9: WARRENS

+ This level is very similar to E3M1, but is much more difficult.
# Just like in Hell Keep, there is a rocket launcher just in the west of the
  small grey chamber <0xfd20a96c,0x76057af> in the NW.  This rocket
  launcher is not available on Ultra-Violence mode and above.
+ Note that many of the hidden rooms full of enemies (the rooms that open when
  you go over the transporter-lookalike in the NW) contain weapons and other
  goodies.  Most beneficial of those is the BFG9000 in the SW corner of the
  lake (west behind the entrance).

[10-3]: When should I use each weapon?
======================================
FIST:  Never use unless you have Berserk.  This is really cool, but not as
good as the chain saw.

CHAIN SAW:  Good for tight corners.  Rips apart the Demons and Spectres.
This is probably the best weapon for non-shooting enemies.  The chain saw
also works wonders on Cacodemons.  They turn away when you start to chop
them, and cannot fire.

PISTOL:  Average weapon.  Does damage to the Former Humans, but the shotgun is
preferred.  Only to be used when in dire need of ammo.

SHOTGUN:  This is probably the best all around weapon.  Use this much of
the time as it is very powerful.  Its only problem is that its rapid fire
is not very fast.  Very useful in "mazes" where enemies are very close but
not in large amounts.

CHAINGUN:  This weapon takes a fair amount of time to kill enemies.  Good
for a lot of monsters in a row.  Also very useful for Imps and Cacodemons,
because the chain gun can keep them from firing back.

ROCKET LAUNCHER:  Good for occasional long shots at many enemies in one
place.  Be careful, however, this weapon can hurt you as well if the
rocket bursts at close range.  Very useful in DeathMatch mode. :)

PLASMA RIFLE:  Rapid fires very quickly.  Hurts some enemies a lot, and
others not as much.  Tends to block the view, which is very dangerous when
you have a large amount of enemies coming toward you.

BFG9000:  The most powerful weapon.  Kills almost ANY enemy in one shot,
but uses a lot of energy cells and rapid fire is very slow.

[10-4]: Where can I get each weapon for the first time?
=======================================================
        Here is a chart that shows on which level in each episode you can
pick up each weapon.

                .-----------------------------------.

Note:  This chart pertains to direct hits only.  Missed shots increase the
       amount of ammunition required to kill any enemy.

(10-9): Which enemies will attack each other?
=============================================
        Projectile monster attacks do not hurt other monsters of the same
species. For example, Imp fireballs do not hurt other Imps, but do hurt
other monsters.  Baron green plasma does not hurt other barons, Cacodemon
gasballs don't hurt other Cacodemons, and Cyberdemons are immune to their own
rockets.
        Bullet attacks are fair game for all.  Troopers, Sergeants, and
Spiderdemons all kill their own kind cheerfully.
        Scratching and biting attacks are hard to misdirect but it does
happen, and when it does, Demons will happily go after each other, as will
Spectres.
        Last but not least, Lost Souls who hit each other will duke it out to
the finish.

CHAPTER *11*: What is DOOM add-on software and where can I get it?
------------------------------------------------------------------

        DOOM add-on software is software, not made by id Software, that
modifies, changes, or helps you with your game when playing DOOM.  Some
examples are cheating utilities, map editors, and sound editors.  This
software is in no way endorsed by id, and neither id Software nor myself
take any responsibility for any problems you have with this software.  DO
NOT contact id regarding any of this software.  Most of this software will
not work on the shareware version of DOOM, by request from id Software.
Most of this software is available from these sites unless specified
otherwise.

it by importing a file.  And, if you're really brave, you can export
all the resources in the WAD file to individual files.

*14-6*: DEHACKED patches
========================

        DEHACKED (see Chapter [13-2]) allows modification of the DOOM.EXE
file.  DEHACKED can be used to create DOOM.EXE patch files, which are used
to save DOOM.EXE settings to be distributed.  To use a DEHACKED patch,
the DEHACKED utility is required (see Chapter [13-2]).  Using the DEHACKED
utility, type this to use a DEHACKED patch file.

        "DEHACKED <WAD file name/path> -LOAD <patch name>.DEH"

        For example, to use a DOOM.WAD in the C:\DOOM directory, and patch
it wil the monster morphing patch, you would use this command line:

        "DEHACKED c:\doom\doom.wad -LOAD monsmorf.deh"

CHAPTER *15*: What other miscellaneous DOOM add-ons exist?
----------------------------------------------------------

[15-1]: BNUDOOM v1.26
=====================

DESCRIPTION:
        A DOOM serial driver replacement utilizing a fossil driver.  Allows
modem-modem connections with modem speeds up to 115K with full error
correction and hardware flow control, non-standard IRQ setups, voice to
modem connections (no need to wait for RING in this case - goes straight to
on-line to get the handshaking going), option NOT to drop DTR after a game
has ended in order to restart the game without losing the connection, and
more.  If you are having trouble with your modem and DOOM, this is for you.

*15-7*: The DOOM Honorific Titles
=================================

DESCRIPTION:
        When you think your DOOM skills are solid and that no monster in
hell can be a match for your shotgun, you have two basic ways of getting
street credit.  One is to win lots of DeathMatches against well-known
players, and the other is to get one or more "DOOM Honorific Titles".
The DHT is a rating system that awards top players with standardized and
universally recognized titles. If you feel proud and/or silly enough,
you can include the relevant letters after your name in your .sig and
impress your fellow DOOM players.

There are four titles to be conquered:

     DOOM Master (DM):               can complete any level on Ultra-Violence.

     DOOM Grand Master (DGM):        can complete any level on Nightmare.

     DOOM Tyson (DT):                can complete any level on Ultra-Violence
                                     using nothing more than fist and pistol.

     DOOM Grand Ass Kicker (DGAK):   has the combined skills of a Master, a
                                     Tyson and a Grand Master.

The titles are awarded by passing an examination. As with most
examinations, this will only be a random sampling of your
capacity. You won't be required to complete all 27 episodes to prove
that you can do it.

You will be your own judge for the results. You will receive the text
of the examination, which tells you what to do to be awarded the title
you think you deserve; from then on you just have to produce the
corresponding LMPs and upload them to a specific public place in a
specific format to be able to call yourself a DM, DT, DGM or DGAK. There
is no time limit. The LMPs must be produced especially for the
examination -- you can't just send in your old ones. This is because
there is an authentication mechanism which prevents people from
recycling other people's LMPs.

CHAPTER [17]: Why won't DOOM work correctly?
--------------------------------------------
        This chapter helps you if you cannot get the game to function as it
should.

[17-1]: How can I use SMARTDRV.EXE with DOOM?
=============================================
         Some people have been complaining about problems with DOOM and
SMARTDRV.EXE.  DOOM is not completely compatible with SMARTDRV.EXE, but
here is how you can get it to work.  Try putting the following command in
your CONFIG.SYS (This will not work in the AUTOEXEC.BAT):

            DEVICE=C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE DOUBLE_BUFFER

        The double buffering uses memory differently than the normal
SMARTDRV.EXE commands.  This command will take up 2k of conventional RAM and
cannot be loaded into high memory.  This has been tested on two machines that
did not work with SMARTDRV.EXE, and this corrected the problem.

[17-2]: Why am I getting an "OUT OF MEMORY" error with DOOM?
============================================================
        If you are receiving an "OUT OF MEMORY" error when attempting to run
DOOM, you might want to attempt any of the following:

        (1) DOOM requires at least 4mb of RAM.  Check to make sure you have
at least this amount.
        (2) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, try holding down the LEFT SHIFT key
during bootup.  This will stop all your TSRs from loading.  Remember to
reinstall your mouse driver, however.
        (3) If you are using MS-DOS v5.0, rename your AUTOEXEC.BAT to stop all
your TSRs from booting.
        (4) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, try running MEMMAKER to free up more
RAM at bootup time.
        (5) If you are using MS-DOS v6.xx, create a boot menu.  For details
on creating a boot menu, type "HELP MENUITEM" at your MS-DOS prompt.
        (5) Try running DOOM without using HIMEM and EMM386.  If you are
using a different memory manager, try removing it instead.


[17-3]: Why does DOOM crash when I start it?
============================================
        Your motherboard may not be compatible with the DOS extender that
DOOM uses.  Try getting DOOM v1.2.  If that still does not work, try running
DOOM with one of the DOS extenders in the file "altdoom1.zip".  See Chapter
[6] for more information on how to get these files.

[17-4]: How can I run DOOM under OS/2?
======================================
        People have been having a lot of trouble getting DOOM v1.x to work

CHAPTER [18]: Why won't my sound card work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------

        This chapter helps fix problems with various sound cards in DOOM.

[18-1]: Why won't my Sound Blaster v1.0 or v1. work with DOOM?
===============================================================
        The v1.0 shareware release of DOOM does not work correctly with
earlier versions of the Sound Blaster.  It is recommended that you receive
v1.2 of DOOM to fix this problem.  Information on getting this upgrade is
available in Chapter [6].
        If you insist on using v1.0 of DOOM, here are two different ways to
fix your problem, although they are not guaranteed to work on all computers.

        (1)  If you have a turbo button on your computer, turn it off.  Run
DOOM, and when the title screen appears, turn it back on.
        (2)  Disable the internal cache.

(18-2): Why won't my Sound Blaster Pro work with DOOM?
======================================================
        If you are using an older graphics card that supports HiColor (16
bit graphics) you may have trouble getting this to work correctly.  The
only recommendation is to borrow a friend's graphics card.
        DOOM v1.1 has a bug that keeps the Sound Blaster Pro from working
on IRQ 2, and later versions do not allow usage on IRQ 10.

(18-3): Why won't my Gravis UltraSound work with DOOM?
======================================================
        To get DOOM to run properly with both music and digitized sound
effects on the Gravis UltraSound use these three steps.

////// SOUND //////

(1) Set your ULTRASND environment variable, and use GF1 IRQ less than 8

    example:  SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5
                                   |_______ GF1 IRQ

NOTE: DOOM v1.2 may be able to use any valid GF1 IRQ including 11,12,15
      However, high IRQs are _not_ recommended.  See BUGS.


////// MUSIC //////

(2) Doom requires that you have installed the General MIDI patch set from
the 2.06a Install Disks (or later) that came with your UltraSound (and are
also available via FTP and BBS).  DOOM will find your patches (using the
ULTRADIR variable) in the MIDI subdirectory pointed to by ULTRADIR.

    example:  SET ULTRADIR=C:\ULTRASND

    (DOOM will look in C:\ULTRASND\MIDI for the patches)

NOTE:  Step 3 is only required for DOOM v1.0 / Operating System 0.99

(3) You will also need to copy ULTRAMID.INI into your DOOM directory and
rename it to DMXGUS.INI (or find and use the DMXGUS.INI file).  ULTRAMID.INI
is a part of the UltraMID/AIL package (also available via FTP and BBS).


////// SETUP //////

Run the SETUP program in the DOOM directory and select the UltraSound for
both sfx and music.  Now run DOOM!


////// BUGS //////

NOTE: DOOM v1.2 is known to occasionally lockup with GUS support.

If you experience frequent lockups AND are using a high GF1 IRQ
(10,11,12,15), try using a low IRQ (less than 8).

If you experience frequent lockups AND have less than 1024K of
GUS RAM, try upgrading to 1024K (1 Megabyte).


////// OPTIMIZING //////

Title                   : GUS1M.WAD

Description             : An optimized MIDI instrument mapping for
                          Gravis Ultrasound cards with 1024K on board.

NOTE!  If you don't have a GUS with 1024K, this wad will gain you
       nothing (but shouldn't hurt anything either).
       This PWAD contains no new MUS music files or sounds whatsoever.
       Nor does it require any new .PAT files, just those supplied
       with the more recent install disks.
========================================================================

Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
     As you probably know, Doom's wad file contains a resource named
DMXGUS which contains a list of all MIDI instruments (patch file
names) and a table specifying which instruments to load into card
memory. Since all 190+ instruments can't be loaded at once, the DMXGUS
file loads a subset of the full GM set and then maps the remaining
instrument numbers to the loaded instruments.

     I was curious about the internal format of MUS files, and pretty
happy when the MIDI2MUS utility was released.  Thanks, guys!  Mucking
around with the original D_* MUS files Doom is supplied with, I
decided to compare the patches they used with the DMXGUS file to see
what kind of mapping was going on.  It turns out there's a lot of it,
but much of it is poorly set up. id's supplied DMXGUS file is almost
exactly the same as the ULTRAMID.INI file supplied with Ultramid 2.00.
That's a good shot at a generic GM mapping, but Doom never uses many
of the loaded instruments... and many of the instruments it DOES use
are mapped to something else.

     Therefore, I've rewritten the DMXGUS file to match Doom's MUS
files as closely as possible.  I've booted out about 40 unused
instruments and added 29 new ones.  The difference is quite dramatic.
Some of the songs have percussion parts that were being thrown out
before; some of the instruments sound quite different.  It's a shame
that id didn't take the time to do this themselves, but I guess
they've been too busy tweaking other stuff.

Ok, how do I use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Extract the GUS1M.WAD file to wherever you normally put new wad
files (ie c:\doom\wad), then use it as you'd use any other new WAD
add-on:

     doom -file WAD\GUS1M.WAD

That's it!  Hopefully you'll hear the difference as soon as Doom's
welcome screen comes up.

Why only 1024K GUS's?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Well, because that's what I own. :)  It's taken about 10 hours of
work to get the 1024K mapping to the point where I'm happy with it. If
someone else would like to help out with mappings for 256, 512 and
768K boards, then go for it!  Feel free to contact me for a few utils
I've written to make >some< of this easier.  Much of it is still trial
and error.

Will it work with id's shareware release of Doom?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Well... yes, it will.  I'm not sure that should be a problem, as
it's not adding anything that wasn't there before... no new levels,
sounds, music, etc.  It's just touching up something that I feel
wasn't properly implemented in the first place.  And more importantly,
I can't think of any way of preventing it.  The typical means to foil
shareware use for new levels is to either insert them into episodes 2
or 3, or to use textures/objects not found in the shareware release.
Neither would work here.

     Look at it this way: it makes the music Doom comes with sound
better on a 1024K GUS.  If you like the change, register Doom and get
ALL the music!  Please give id your support.  They're writing the best
damn games on the market, publishing them as shareware, and supporting
the GUS.  What more could we want?  Please let them know you
appreciate it.

[18-4]: Why does the game crash when using my Gravis UltraSound?
================================================================
        DOOM v1.2 has a small bug which causes DOOM to crash on some
systems, some of the time.  People have reported that these crashes
can be minimized by using an IRQ at 7 or less, and upgrading the GUS'
on-board RAM to 1024k.

[18-5]: Why won't my Pro Audio Spectrum 16 work with DOOM?
==========================================================
        You may be using an older version of DOOM such as v1.0 or v1.1.
Get DOOM v1.666 for full PAS-16 support in native mode.
        If the game is locking up after the "HU Init" line, there is a
solution.  Make sure you are loading your PAS MVPRODD.SYS driver low.
Loading it high can cause DOOM to lock up.

[18-6]: Why won't my ATI Stereo-F/X work with DOOM?
===================================================
        Turning off DMA buffering in the sound card's SFX.EXE
configuration program should fix this problem.

[19-1]: Why won't my mouse work with DOOM?
==========================================

[19-1-1]: Why does my mouse start moving itself during play?
------------------------------------------------------------
        It is recommended that you upgrade to DOOM v1.666 to fix this
problem.
        Older mouse drivers cause a problem with DOOM v1.2.  Make sure you are
using Microsoft mouse drivers v9.x instead of v8.x.  Logitech mouse drivers
v6.x work as well.  The newest Logitech mouse drivers are available at the
FTP site "wuarchive.wustl.edu" in the directory
"/systems/ibmpc/msdos/mouse" under the file name "drvr???.zip" where ??? is
the version number of the drivers.
        If you continue to have this problem, try playing with the keyboard
or joystick, with the mouse unplugged.  DOOM has a bug that causes it to do
strange things at times.

[19-1-2]: Why won't my two button mouse work with DOOM?
-------------------------------------------------------
        DOOM's SETUP.EXE program assumes that one has a three button mouse.
The left button is "fire," the right button is "forward," and the center
button is "strafe."  If you run the setup program that comes with DOOM, you
can assign "strafe" to the right mouse button, and the setting for "Move
Forward" then appears to be blank. In actuality, "Move Forward" is set to be
permanently "on." This can be fixed easily.  Edit the file "DEFAULT.CFG" in
your DOOM directory with any text editor.  The three lines of interest
are: mouseb_fire, mouseb_strafe, and mouseb_forward. The settings for these
are 0 (left button), 1 (middle button) and 2 (right button).  When you ran
the setup program, mouseb_forward was assigned a value of -1.  Go ahead and
change this to "1", save the file and restart DOOM.  The final entries
should appear as:

mouseb_fire      0
mouseb_strafe    2
mouseb_forward   1

        This will allow you to shoot with the left button and strafe with the
right button.

(19-1-3): Why won't my IBM PS/2 mouse work with DOOM?
-----------------------------------------------------
        The IBM PS/2 mouse does not seem to work well with DOOM.  id
Software is working on a solution to this problem.  The only current
solution that has been discovered is to load DOOM under Windows.  Doing
this allows the mouse to work perfectly.

(19-2): Why does netDOOM seem to crash at certain times?
========================================================
        This is a known bug in v1.2 of DOOM.  Upgrade to v1.666, it fixes
this problem.

(19-3): Why won't my modem work with DOOM?
==========================================
        You may use a non-standard IRQ for your COM port.  You can get the
"DOOMODEM.ZIP" utility to fix this.  (see Chapter [15-7])
        DOOM seems to be very picky about certain kinds of modems and the
initialization strings you use with them.  Here is a list of initialization
strings that seem to work well.  Many modems have more than one in this
list; if one does not work, try another one.  Place these initialization
strings in the first line(s) of your MODEM.CFG file.

[19-4]: Why is my network slowing down when using DOOM?
=======================================================
        You may have an older version of DOOM, such as v1.0 or v1.1.  These
older versions utilized broadcast packets, which slow down many networks.
Upgrading to v1.666 will fix this problem, since v1.666 utilizes direct
packets.

(19-5): Why won't the v1.666 patch install correctly?
===================================================
        The DOOM v1.666 patch expects to find the ORIGINAL game in your DOOM
directory.  If you replaced or altered the DOOM.EXE file with a new
version, the patch will not work.
        If the patch complains about missing "LICENSE.DOC" and/or
"FILE_ID.DIZ," the command "PATCH -ignoremissing" can be used.  However,
this will not help if the patch complains about "DOOM.EXE" or "DOOM.WAD."
        If you are using the registered version, some distributors shipped
an older release of v1.1.  It is recommended that you call your
distributor, or E-mail "help@idsoftware.com" if you ordered from id
Software for more help.

[19-6]: DOOM is too easy
========================
        If you find DOOM too easy, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on a harder difficulty level.
        (2) Only save your game at the beginning of each level.
        (3) Never save your game and try completing the mission.
        (4) Only use your fist and pistol for the entire game.
        (5) Turn down your screen contrast so you can see less.
        (6) Use the "-respawn" parameter upon loading DOOM to allow the
            monsters to revive in other difficulty levels.

[19-7]: DOOM is too hard
========================
        If you find DOOM too hard, here are some suggestions.

        (1) Play on an easier difficulty level.
        (2) Save your game often.
        (3) Try using some of the cheat codes or a cheating utility.
        (4) Turn up your screen contrast so you can see more.
        (5) Press F11 during game play for gamma correction.

[19-8]: I get motion sickness when playing DOOM
===============================================
        There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon.  In short
some people experience dizziness attributed to the game movement.  There were
many theories, most along the line of motion sickness.  Some also said that
the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into believing it to be
real.  Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like being sea sick.
Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration (like on-off high
speed) attribute to the nausea.  I will not go into discussion of why.
Instead, I will post some steps people suggested.  Remedies are not
guaranteed to work.  There are many, all are experimental and some will have
opposite effects on different people.  This, it seems, is a very individual
problem.

        (1) Try different display sizes.  Either use different size monitors
or use the screen size option to vary the display window.

        (2) Try sitting closer/further from the display (don't stick your
nose in it, I don't want you to get radiation sick).  Try combining this with
focusing/defocusing on the display or surroundings.  This is to see if you
are being aware that you are looking at the monitor and hopefully it may
convince your brain that what you play is not really real.

        (3) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try
playing with it on/off.

        (4) Try different input devices.  With a mouse you can control
acceleration more accurately than with a joystick or the keyboard.

        (5) Play on your friend's/colleague's computer. See if it is
better/worse.

        (6) Have breaks while you play.  Play in turns.  Watch others play &
then play yourself.

        (7) If you have sound card, try playing with/without the sound. If
your sound card is stereo try playing with headphones on.   Reverse the
headphones so that left becomes right.

        After switching machines, many have problems adjusting too.
On a 486, things may seem "too smooth."  On a 386, it may make you want to
vomit.  Sometimes you just have to give time to adjust.

CHAPTER (20): Confidential NORAD transmission
---------------------------------------------

        Well, Chapter [20] has gotten a lot of feedback.  This is the
chapter where I place the newest edition to DOOM iNsAnItY, the comedy file
I also publish about DOOM.  If you enjoy this chapter, download
"dinsan57.txt" on your favorite online service or FTP site.
        You can thank "Clint" (ffjjd@acad3.alaska.edu) for this one!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I work for NORAD (North American Defense) and recently the
following transmission was received from the planet Mars. Originally
it was classified top secret and sealed away in a vault. I felt it was
too important to humanity and so I absconded  with  a copy of it and
have decided to release it to the world. I fear for the future of
humanity. The message is as follows:

(lots of static and radio frequency type noises which finally clear. A
bunch of voices can be heard mumbling to one another.)

Voice 1: Are we on?

Voice 2: What's going on? Did you guys get a link yet?

Voice 3: We're on man we've got a clean connection.

Voice 2: oh we're on?

Voice 1: I think we're on.

Voice 4: (booming and aggravated) You're on you damn morons start
talking now or I missile your faces.

EX-MARINE ROGER JOHNSON: Hello earthlings. How's it going? We've
got a problem up here on Mars. You guys keep coming up here and
attacking us. And I'm not talking about just a few of you, this must
be the rage or something because you guys seem to be coming in
droves. What's the deal? Can't you just leave us alone? What did we
ever do to hurt you guys? You probably think we're the problem.
You probably think we started all of this but actually it was you
guys. Sure we shoot back now but wouldn't you too? Sometimes we
even shoot first just because we're all so edgy. But it's all because of
the havoc and destruction you have wrought on our once peaceful
little colony. Why can't you just stay on Earth and leave us all alone?

I'm going to tell you something right now you've got a lot of the
residents up here really pissed and I don't think they're all going to
take this lying down. Some of these guys are starting to get really
irritated so you better watch yourselves. Anyway I don't want to
sound threatening..... Oh darn a piece of my rotten arm just fell off.....
ouch that smarts. Like I was saying I don't want to sound
threatening or anything but you guys are taking a toll on us and I
was just wondering if you maybe you could chill out a little bit?
Would that be possible?

BOOMING VOICE: Get that whimpering [annoyance] out of there before I
missile his head.

EX-SERGEANT BUD SCHIMTZ: Sergeant schmitz here. Look folks lets
talk numbers here for a minute. Do you have any idea what the kill
ratio we're looking at here is? I don't have hard numbers but it's
something like 50 to 1. You folks are killing fifty of our young men
for every one of you that we kill. And like roger said, this is all in
self defense. Now what in God's name are you savages trying to
accomplish. These are fine young men who could have had careers.
They could have had futures. But no you [idiots] had to come on
along and wreak absolute havoc on our peaceful Mars colony. I HOPE
YOU ALL DIE MISERABLE, PAINFUL DEATHS WITH SALT POURED ON
YOUR GAPING WOUNDS!!!!!

IMP: See now you've gotten sarg all upset. He's not going to be right
for the rest of the afternoon. See what you guys have done? You've
caused quite a stir up here. Well let me get to the heart of this
message. You see so far you folks have been the aggressors and we
have been sitting here like sheep just waiting to be picked off. You
don't think we're going to let this go on forever do you? I'm just
going to say what I'm hinting at- WE'RE COMING AFTER YOU
BASTARDS!!!! Got that. Don't think you can just sit there in your
ivory tower and launch invasion after invasion on our colony and
expect us to take it sitting down. Earth is open to invasion too you
know. This is a two way street. What comes around goes around. Do
as I say not as I do.... wait a minute that  was the wrong cliche, at
any rate be forewarned. We are planning an invasion of your feeble
little planet. We've decided that we've had enough. It's our turn to be
the aggressors and your turn to be the victims. Sort of like Clarence
Thomas and Anita Hill. Or that dame and Bill Clinton - WE ARE GOING
TO HARASS THE HELL OUT OF YOU!!. Consider yourselves warned.

(pause)

BOOMING VOICE: I liked his tone. Did anybody else like his tone?

EVERYBODY ELSE: Yes!

BOOMING VOICE: Who's next?

PINK GORILLA: Did you guys know that if I wanted to I could bite
your entire face off in just one bite? Take a look at my jaws
sometime. They're fraggin' HUGE. I've just been restraining myself up
to this point. From now on it's no holds barred. When we come to
earth I'm taking one face per bite. Got that? One bite equals one face.
I'll be seein' you soon.

BOOMING VOICE: I like that. Short and to the point. I've always liked
Pinky. He speaks my language- succinct and threatening. That's good.

SPECTRE: Spectre here. Look folks, you brought all of this on
yourselves. What did you expect? Now as for my invisibility
algorithm. Up to this point it's been fairly successful. It works real
good in the dark. But I know you guys can still see me. I've looked at
some of the other guys and I can always see this outline, this kind of
shimmering form, you know what I'm talking about. Well not much
longer you won't because we've been working on the algorithm and
we've made some marked improvements. By the time this ones
finished you jerks aren't going to be able to see JACK. Keep that
in mind when you tuck in your children tonight. We're coming for
you. Sleep tight.

FLAMING HEAD: Am I supposed to talk now? Is it my turn?

BOOMING VOICE: Do you see anybody else at the microphone
RETARD!!

FLAMING HEAD: Oh right, it's Cacodemon's turn.

BOOMING VOICE: He's in the bathroom right now you [fraggin'] dolt.
Speak now or be ERADICATED. (mechanical sounds can be heard)

FLAMING HEAD: Right, sure, OK, well. Say earthlings did you know
that all I've been trying to do this whole time is light one of you guys
on fire. That's my big goal. I just want to crash into one of you guys
and just see you light up like a Christmas tree. Sure I'll bite you and
stuff but that's usually because I'm frustrated. What I really want to
see is one of you fella's ON FIRE. Then you could run around and
bump into your buddies and light them on fire too. Then you'd all be
on FIRE. Pretty soon there'd be fire everywhere. FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE.

VOICE ON THE SIDE: Uh oh. He's getting on one of those fire kicks
again.

FLAMING HEAD: FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE

In the background mechanical sounds can be heard. Mechanisms and
gears and engines firing up. Suddenly a rocket can be heard
approaching followed by a LOUD explosion.

Several moments of silence.

VOICE 1: Are we back up again?
VOICE 2: Yeah we're on again. Good thing I brought several
microphones I knew this was going to happen.

BOOMING VOICE: Let that be a lesson to all of you. Lose your cool on
the stand and I'm going to blast you and the [fraggin'] podium to Earth.
Who's next?

BARON: Yeah that would be me.

BOOMING VOICE: Go ahead.

CACODEMON: I think I was supposed to go next.

BARON: Oh right. It's your turn.

CACODEMON: No offense.

BARON: None taken.

CACODEMON: Great, just let me squeeze in there.

BARON: You need to lose some weight.

CACODEMON: I know I've been working on that but it's a problem
I've had all my life.

Mechanical sounds can be heard in the background.

CACODEMON: Howdy everyone. You heard the Baron mention my
weight well I've been thinking. Rather than trying to lose the weight
maybe I should put it to my advantage. I've been thinking about
transforming myself into a Flaming Bowling Ball from Hell. What do
you all think?

a lot of mumbling and discussion in the background.

VOICE: What would happen when you hit a pool of acid?

CACODEMON: I don't know I guess I could dissolve or something.

BARON: You want the truth, what I really think?

CACO: Sure.

BARON: Sorry but I think it bites.

CACO: Ok well I don't have to become a bowling ball, but I could
throw my weight around a little more. Instead of just shooting
pretty, sparkly, purple balls at people I could corner them in tight
situations and just smash the crap out of them.

(pause)

BARON: That's not at all a bad idea. I like that. Do you think it would
get the kill ratio down from the current 50 to 1?

CACO: Absolutely.

BARON: I say do it. What do the rest of you think?

VOICES: Yes, good, do it, sounds good to me.

BOOMING VOICE: OK it's done. Start throwing that weight around
fatty. We're going to need all the help we can get. Baron you're on.

BARON: Well what can I say that hasn't already been said. How about
if I just say what's on my mind. You suckers are dead. You're minced
meat. You're toast. You're going to wish you were never born. You
haven't felt pain yet. You don't know the meaning of pain. You're
going to see that kill ratio drop from 50 to 1 in your favor to 50 to 1
in our favor. As far as personal modifications go, I'll be shooting
flames out of my hands, like I do now, as well as out of my feet, my
eyes, my ears, my mouth, my knees and for those who sneak up
behind me I've got a special surprise for you. Let's just say I'm going
to be a lot tougher. See you at your favorite city or coming soon to a
neighborhood near you.

BOOMING VOICE: OK, it's your turn.

SPIDER DEMON: Well I have to admit Baron is looking a lot tougher
these days. In fact I think he's started to muscle in on my turf. I
don't know, I don't feel at all comfortable with this development.....

Large crashing sounds.

BOOMING VOICE: Out of the way milktoast. This is CYBERDEMON here
and I'm going to make it real plain and simple. We're coming to your
planet. We're coming for revenge and we're coming to eradicate you
pathetic little wimps. We're coming for the pure fun of blowing you
all limb from scrawny little limb. We'll be there soon, (aside) what
would you say two weeks?

BARON: Yeah about two weeks.

CYBERDEMON: Two weeks and you won't be able to stop us. Consider
yourselves forewarned. This is going to be the mother of all battles.
It's going to be the end of life as you know it. It's going to be the end
of human civilization. In short it's going to be HELL ON EARTH. This
game is not over man.

(stunned silence)
(after several moments)

VOICE: OK that's it, kill the link.

Some clanking around can be heard which is followed by pure static.
