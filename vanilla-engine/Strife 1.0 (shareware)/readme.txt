=========================== STRIFE  v1.0 ===================================

Welcome to the demo of Strife, one of the most unique 3-d games ever. Strife
will take you into a world which combines the fast-paced action of a shoot'em
up with a riveting role-playing story-line. This demo gives you a taste,
a small taste, of what lies ahead. More enemies; bigger, badder weapons; and
the rest of the gigantic Strife world to explore.

The game supports 8 player deathmatch slaughter-fests, for which we will
soon send out a patch for the demo version. So for now, enjoy the interaction,
but be ready to show your friends what the business end of a flamethrower
looks like!

Don't forget to run the setup.exe before starting Strife.

We hope you enjoy Strife. We would love to hear any comments or suggestions
that you may have.

The retail version will be released soon; so be ready! Reminder: This is only
a demo, purchase Strife to continue the action!
