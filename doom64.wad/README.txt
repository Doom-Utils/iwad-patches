Doom 64 has had a stadalone release on PC and consoles since 2020,
from which time the game actually has a distinct IWAD able to be set
apart from the engine, acting more like other Doom games on PC.

On the Nintendo 64, there still was somewhat of a distinction between
the engine and IWAD, but it becomes a technical detail when the only
useful unit for that console is the complete ROM image.
