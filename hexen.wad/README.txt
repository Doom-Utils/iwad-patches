Hexen went through a few technical changes from 1.0 to 1.1, one of
which includes moving text strings (left to the engine itself in 1.0)
to the IWAD.  This actually makes playing Hexen 1.0 problematic on
source ports, where only 1.1 is well-supported.

“Beta” is a release made only on the warez scene, leaked from Raven
before the game was finished.  It should only be played with the
equivalent engine files (see the vanilla-engine directory).  Being
released to the world only via warez, there is no legitimate reason
you should need to upgrade from it to a newer version of Hexen, thus
the patch here is to only go backwards from 1.1.
